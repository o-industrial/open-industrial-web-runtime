# Workspace Liberty Landing Page Plan

## Source Material

- [Liberty Edition Seed](./seed.md) ‚Äì use as the canonical narrative foundation.
- Key seed sections to reference:
  - ‚ÄúCase Study: From Locked Data to Living Systems‚Äù for hero storytelling and proof.
  - ‚ÄúWorkspaces: Your Domain of Control‚Äù for feature bullets, InlineUXTip language, and screenshot caption.
  - ‚ÄúThe Road Ahead: Liberty in Motion‚Äù for CTA sequencing.

## Landing Page Summary

- **Purpose:** Convert data architects and solution owners exploring modernization into Evaluation Workspace sign-ups or demo requests.
- **Campaign Alignment:** Pairs with top-of-funnel ‚ÄúUnlock Industrial Liberty‚Äù ads and webinar follow-ups.
- **Primary CTA:** `Get Started in the Evaluation Workspace`.
- **Secondary CTA:** `Schedule a Guided Demo`.

## Audience & Relevance

- [x] Validate persona fit with Data Architects, Platform Engineering leads, and Innovation Directors.
- Pain anchors:
  - Disconnected tools causing version chaos (`Workspaces: Your Domain of Control` copy in Liberty Edition draft).
  - Manual pipeline backlog (hero copy in `src/marketing/home.ts:104-138`).
- Desired outcomes:
  - Own iterative loops (Save ‚Üí Commit ‚Üí Deploy).
  - Maintain governance while moving fast (commit history, rollback).

## Narrative Arc & Positioning

- [x] Confirm opening narrative references the Midwest manufacturer case study for credibility.
- [x] Use ‚ÄúLiberty‚Äù framing with explicit contrast against siloed legacy systems.
- [x] Reinforce authorship/ownership theme in every major module.

### Messaging Pillars

1. **Domain of Control:** Multiple workspaces, each with clear lineage (`Liberty Edition` Workspaces section; `homeContent.howItWorks` and `homeContent.unifiedHub`).
2. **Governed Velocity:** Save ‚Üí Commit ‚Üí Deploy loop, rollback, audit readiness (`src/marketing/home.ts:130-140`, `solutions/quality-management.ts` outcomes).
3. **Immediate Proof:** 30-minute case study walkthrough; highlight 2-week cycle ‚Üí afternoon stat.
