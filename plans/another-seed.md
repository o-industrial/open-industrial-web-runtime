In the late 1900's and early 2000's corporate America was focused on creating software that locked you into an operating system. By the 2010's that same profit-motivation had (d)evolved into social media driven surveillance capitalism. That merged with Silicon Valley's Everything-as-a-Service (using Dark Patterns)

in an effort to extract the maximum value from every byte of data and suck you into platform-lock. What is the logical next evolution of software and the technology ecosystem?
AI enters the chat.
Artificial Intelligence, the mega-hype-bubble of our time, has become the zeitgeist, job-killing boogieman.
I keep having the same thought: if we are going to release a platform that's Software Imbued Synthetic Intelligence how do we market that?
Maybe people don't know what "Imbued" means... Not a new UI. Not a new SaaS. A new way of working with computers. A new paradigm. We know in the end its just the same human-to-silicon relationship but from a marketeering perspective we need to distinguish ourselves. Ultimately an iPhone was just a Blackberry without a physical keyboard and a slightly better UI.

The problem with software: we're still making software with UI in the age of AI.
At 9:40 in the video: "Real desktop class applications"
What's OpenIndustrial's equivalent? Real... what?
It's not about democracy, democratization or gamification - it's about actually having the freedom to do what you need to do with your technology. It's not even just freedom.
It's liberty.
Liberty meaning being free from oppressive restrictions imposed by "authority."
The "Liberty to Wield" your software as an individual without arbitrary restraints - which is what most "enterprise" software is perpetuated by: restrained from freeing your data, restrained from building solutions on top of your software.
Freedom is the ability to act or think as one wants, without hindrance, its the idea of self-determination, personal choice and capability.
Liberty is the state of being free.
OpenIndustrial isn't de-siloing. It's software liberty for industrial.
Finally.
Ilya Sutskever, the co-founder of OpenAI, meant to say "You may not take interest in AI, but AI will take interest in you." https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zuZ2zaotrJs&t=7m48s
