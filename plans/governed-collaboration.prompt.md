# Governed Collaboration Landing Page Prompt

## Objective

Develop full landing-page copy and campaign collateral for “Governed Collaboration,” guided by `plans/governed-collaboration.plan.md` and the source narrative in `plans/seed.md`.

## Preparation Steps

1. Study:
   - `plans/seed.md` (focus on “Users & Teams,” “Azi,” “Conclusion”).
   - `plans/governed-collaboration.plan.md`.

   - `src/marketing/solutions/device-integration.ts` for token-scope and audit examples.
   - `src/marketing/solutions/quality-management.ts` for compliance stories.
   - Routing target: new page lives at `apps/home/liberty/governed-collaboration.tsx`.
2. Capture quotes and phrases:
   - “Invite, assign, and empower—no gatekeepers required.”
   - Guardrail trio: “Governed from the Start / Explainable by Default / Instant Activation.”
   - AziInnerVoice cadence for governance scenario.
