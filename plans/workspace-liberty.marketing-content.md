# Workspace Liberty Marketing Content Drafts

## LinkedIn Thought Leadership Post (Data Architects)

> **Headline:** Unlock Industrial Liberty: From Locked Data to Living Systems  
> **Body:**  
> Six months of SCADA telemetry were stuck inside nightly PDFs. Two-week validation cycles made “continuous improvement” a punchline.  
>  
> When a Midwest manufacturer activated the Workspace Liberty evaluation, they watched Azi surface hidden anomalies in minutes—and shipped a governed alert dashboard in under 30 minutes.  
>  
> **Why it mattered:**  
> - Every workspace is a governed domain: logic, lineage, deployment in your hands.  
> - Save → Commit → Deploy happens on your schedule, with rollback proof baked in.  
> - “Data isn’t useful until it’s alive.” Liberty makes it breathe.  
>  
> **What you can do today:**  
> 1. Spin up an evaluation workspace (no pipeline backlog).  
> 2. Pair with Azi to publish your first warm query.  
> 3. Diff, rollback, and deploy with confidence.  
>  
> **Ready to author your own workspace?**  
> 👉 `Get Started in the Evaluation Workspace` (UTM: `utm_source=linkedin&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=workspace-liberty`)  
> 👉 `Schedule a Guided Demo` (UTM: `utm_source=linkedin&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=workspace-liberty&utm_content=thought-leadership`)

## Short Demo Video Script (60–90s)

1. **Hook (0–10s):** “What if your engineers could ship governed dashboards in 30 minutes?”  
   - Visual: Cold start workspace, timer overlay.  
2. **Setup (10–25s):** Show telemetry locked in reports; mention liberty ethos.  
3. **Action (25–55s):**  
   - Save: Azi recommending warm query, highlight prompt.  
   - Commit: Diff + rollback preview, governance callouts.  
   - Deploy: Dashboard goes live, alerts created.  
4. **Proof (55–70s):** Stat badges (minutes to anomaly, afternoon validation).  
5. **CTA (70–90s):** “Author your own workspace” – dual CTA lower third with UTM overlays.

## Retargeting Display Assets (Copy + CTA)

- **300x250:** “Author Your Workspace. Ship dashboards in 30 minutes.” — CTA: `Start Evaluation`  
- **728x90:** “Save → Commit → Deploy. Liberty for industrial data.” — CTA: `See It Live`  
- **160x600:** “Governed quick wins for batch, downtime, safety.” — CTA: `Launch Now`  
- **Social Static:** “Data isn’t useful until it’s alive. Make it living.” — CTA: `Author Workspace`

## Supporting Ops Tasks

- **KPI Proof Collection:**  
  - Owner: Product Analytics  
  - Data Needed: 2-week → afternoon validation cycle, 30-minute dashboard build, 40% faster API launch.  
  - Status: Requested; awaiting updated dashboard snapshots and anomaly detection logs.

- **UTM Plan (Channel Mapping):**  
  - LinkedIn Thought Leadership: `utm_source=linkedin&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=workspace-liberty&utm_content=thought-leadership`  
  - LinkedIn Carousel: `utm_source=linkedin&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=workspace-liberty&utm_content=carousel`

- **Design Coordination Notes:**  
  - Carousel + display assets require gradient overlays consistent with Workspace Liberty palette (`#060b1c` base, neon blue/purple highlights).  
  - Provide quick win prompts and stat badges to Creative Studio.  
  - Animation concept for commit diff remains in backlog—sync with motion team for storyboard by Friday.
