# Governed Collaboration Campaign Collateral

This package pairs with `apps/home/liberty/governed-collaboration.tsx` and the content model in `src/marketing/liberty/governed-collaboration.ts`. Everything leans on the Liberty narrative: invite, assign, and empower without gatekeepers while every action stays explainable.

## LinkedIn Executive Brief (200 words)

**Headline:** Governed Collaboration Without Gatekeepers\
**CTA:** [Schedule a Governance Review](https://www.openindustrial.co/contact#form?utm_source=linkedin&utm_medium=executive-brief&utm_campaign=governed-collaboration)

Program leaders keep asking the same question: how do we move faster without letting contractors and integrators roam the plant? Legacy IAM answers with another queue. OpenIndustrial answers with invite-only workspaces, token-scoped roles, and Azi walking every decision through the safest path.

Governed collaboration starts with the roster. Workspace membership is invite-only, time boxed, and every approval captures intent. Roles stay opinionated—Viewer, Editor, Maintainer, Admin—so you know exactly who can ship a change. Switch a contractor from read to read-write and the audit trail updates itself before the line restarts.

Quality and compliance teams finally get replayable proof. Deterministic warm queries bundle release context, CAPAs, and deviation notes the moment issues escalate. When OSHA or the FDA calls, you export a packet in minutes, not weeks.

Azi is the opinionated partner in liberty. She offers three governance paths, cites the policies behind each one, and never bypasses the human-in-the-loop. Invite, assign, and empower your teams without handing over your sovereignty.

Book a governance review to see how fast invite-only collaboration becomes your fastest compliance win.

## Industry Newsletter Pitch

**Abstract (118 words)**\
Regulated manufacturers no longer need to choose between velocity and oversight. Invite-only OpenIndustrial workspaces keep collaboration inside token-scoped guardrails so every deployment, dashboard, and deviation stay explainable by default. We'll show how VP Operations teams launch contractor squads without IAM backlog, how Quality directors export audit packets in minutes, and how OT Security leads flip access without touching privileged credentials. The feature covers the Guardrails Trio—Governed from the Start, Explainable by Default, Instant Activation—and walks through an FDA and OSHA field story so readers leave with a practical runbook. Close with a live CTA: register for the "Governance Without Gatekeepers" webinar or schedule a governance review.

**Talking Points**

- Invite-only workspaces with role matrix clarity.
- Token-scoped enforcement mapped to every endpoint.
