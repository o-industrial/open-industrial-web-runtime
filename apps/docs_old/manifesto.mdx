# The Open Industrial Manifesto

Youâ€™ve been burned before.  
By tools that locked you in.  
By platforms that changed under your feet.  
By systems that treated your logic like a featureâ€”not an asset.

We built OpenIndustrial for people whoâ€™ve had enough.

This isnâ€™t a feature list.  
Itâ€™s a promise.

Not a legal oneâ€”a personal one.  
This is what we believe.  
And what weâ€™re building to protect.

## You Own Your Logic

Every surface. Every schema. Every signal.

You can pin it. Fork it. Version it.  
You can export it. Carry it. Or walk away with it.

Itâ€™s yours. Always.

---

## You Own Your Data

We donâ€™t harvest. We donâ€™t scrape.  
Azi sees what you show herâ€”and forgets what you take away.

Your structure is yours. So is your silence.

---

## You Own Your Decisions

Azi raises signals. But you raise the bar.

Only you choose what gets promoted, adapted, or evolved.  
This isnâ€™t auto-pilot. Itâ€™s active governance.

---

## Azi Evolves With Youâ€”Not For You

She doesnâ€™t guess. She observes.  
She doesnâ€™t override. She asks.  
She learns your worldâ€”at your pace, on your terms.

---

## Schema Is Languageâ€”Not Configuration

Youâ€™re not configuring a product.  
Youâ€™re teaching a collaborator.

Schema promotion is how you formalize what matters.  
Structure becomes meaning. Meaning becomes behavior.

---

## Execution Is Persistentâ€”Not Ephemeral

You donâ€™t chase dashboards. You build systems that run.

Execution surfaces are versioned, live, and teachable.  
This isnâ€™t analysis. This is adaptation.

---

## Autonomy Is Built-Inâ€”Not Opt-In

You can fork anything.  
Export everything.  
Leave anytime.

No approvals. No accounts. No goodbye forms.

Azi never locks you in. She works for youâ€”or not at all.

---

## If You Ever Leave

She forgets.  
You donâ€™t lose history. You donâ€™t lose logic.  
You donâ€™t lose structure.

Everything you builtâ€”every surface, every schema, every signalâ€”remains yours.

You can walk away clean.

## This Is Your System

Youâ€™re not just using OpenIndustrial.  
Youâ€™re co-creating it. With Azi. With intention.

Weâ€™re building it to respect youâ€”especially when youâ€™re done.
