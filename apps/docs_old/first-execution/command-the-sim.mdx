# Command the Sim

> *"You send a command. The structure changes."*

Until now, Azi has observed passively. You’ve taught through what already exists.

But what happens when you introduce something new?

## Trigger New Input

In your Surface, find `humidity-sensor-001`. It’s paused by default. Click **“Enable Emission.”**

While this looks like a UI toggle, under the hood you’re sending a command to the simulator—something your agents could do too.

Within moments, the sensor begins emitting:

```json
{ "ID": "humidity-sensor-001", "Humidity": 74.2 }
```

This is new structure. Azi spots it immediately.

## Azi Proposes `HumiditySensor`

As with `TemperatureSensor`, Azi proposes a new schema:

```json
{
  "ID": { "source": "connectionId", "type": "string", "primary": true },
  "Humidity": { "source": "humidity", "type": "number", "unit": "%" }
}
```

Click **Promote Schema** to confirm. Azi saves it as `HumiditySensor v1`.

## Evolve the Reference Data

New data means new thresholds. Let’s update your `RoomThresholdConfig`.

### Edit the Schema

In the reference data panel, find `RoomThresholdConfig`. Click **Edit Schema** and add:

```json
{
  "Room": { "type": "string", "primary": true },
  "DesiredTemp": { "type": "number" },
  "HumidityThreshold": { "type": "number" }
}
```

Click **Promote Schema**. Azi versions this as `RoomThresholdConfig v2`.

### Update the Values

Now, use Azi’s auto-generated view to enter your updated data:

```json
[
  { "Room": "Lab1", "DesiredTemp": 72, "HumidityThreshold": 60 }
]
```

Click **Save Data**.

## Azi Proposes `RoomState v2`

With the new telemetry and updated reference data, Azi proposes an updated composite schema:

```json
{
  "Room": "Lab1",
  "Temperature": 83.2,
  "DesiredTemp": 72,
  "FanDevice": "fan-controller-001",
  "FanPower": "off",
  "Humidity": 74.2,
  "HumidityThreshold": 60
}
```

Click **Promote Schema**. Azi handles versioning—it becomes `RoomState v1.2`.

Now, your agents will see not just what’s happening, but whether that state is acceptable—across multiple dimensions.

> *💡 Thinky Tip: You don’t just observe evolution. You trigger it.*

Next: [Evolve the Agent] → You’ll upgrade your agent to reason with `RoomState v2`.
