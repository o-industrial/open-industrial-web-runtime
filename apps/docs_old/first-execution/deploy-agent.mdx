# Deploy the Agent + React to Flow

> *"You deploy. The fan responds."*

You’ve defined the structure. You’ve written the logic. Now it’s time to run it.

## Deploy Your Agent

Open your `Main` surface and click **“Add Agent”**. Select your `FanControlAgent` and assign it to the surface.

That’s it. No wiring. No scheduling. You’ve deployed logic into a live execution lattice.

*Caption: Deploy your agent to begin responding to live impulses.*

## The Moment of Execution

Once deployed, your agent listens for impulses that match the `TemperatureSensor` schema. When one like this flows in:

```json
{ "ID": "temperature-sensor-001", "Temperature": 84.2 }
```

The agent executes immediately. Azi confirms the logic fired:

> *"Agent executed. Command sent to turn on the fan."*

## System Response

The fan controller reacts in real time:

```json
{ "ID": "fan-controller-001", "Power": "on" }
```

No button was clicked. No pipeline was run. The system observed, matched, executed, and adapted—all through the structure you defined.

> *💡 Thinky Tip: Execution is the product. Schema is the trigger. You are the architect.*
