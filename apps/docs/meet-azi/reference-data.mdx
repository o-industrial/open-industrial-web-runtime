# Add Simple Reference Data

You just asked your first real question—and Azi turned it into live execution. But what if she could go even deeper?

This step teaches Azi the *meaning* behind your structure. With just a small table or two, she’ll start recognizing names, spotting anomalies, and asking better questions.

You’re not just refining the model. You’re giving her a shared sense of what “normal” looks like.

## 📚 What Is Reference Data?

Reference data is static, structured context. It’s not a live Impulse stream—it’s the background knowledge Azi can use to make smarter decisions.

Think of it like a glossary, a list of expected ranges, or a map that links internal codes to human meaning. It might include:

- A table mapping `device_id` to `room_name`
- Expected thresholds for each `sensor_type`
- Shift schedules that define what "daytime" and "overnight" mean

> _"If Impulses are what’s happening, reference data is how to make sense of it."_

When you promote a reference table, you’re handing Azi a page of your system’s playbook.

## 🛠️ Create Your First Reference Table

Let’s build a quick reference table right in place.

In your shared environment:

1. Click **“Add Reference Data”**
2. Choose **“Create Inline”**
3. Name your table — e.g. `device_directory`
4. Define the columns:
   - `device_id` (string)
   - `room_name` (string)
   - `type` (string)
5. Add a few rows like this:

```
| device_id | room_name | type      |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| pump01    | Room 7    | Pump      |
| sensor22  | Line B    | Pressure  |
| fan09     | Hallway   | Cooling   |
```

6. Review the inferred schema
7. Click **“Promote”** to confirm it

That’s it—you’ve just taught Azi how to read device IDs in a way that actually means something.

## 🧠 How Azi Gets Smarter

When you promote reference data, Azi starts forming hypotheses about how your world fits together.

She doesn’t yet know the rules—but now she has building blocks to work with:

- ✅ She uses friendly names in results
- ✅ She flags values outside expected thresholds
- ✅ She recognizes time-based patterns, like shifts or outages

But what about **joins**? What if you ask:

> *“Show me average pressure by room.”*

Azi will **attempt** to relate your Impulse data to the new reference table using column names like `device_id`—but it’s still a guess. She might need your help.

This is a moment of co-evolution: you coach Azi into deeper understanding, and those lessons stick.

## 💡 Why It Matters

This is your first real act of **teaching meaning**.

You’re not just piping in data. You’re telling Azi what your codes, units, and structures represent.

That meaning might be simple today—but it unlocks:

- Better answers in natural queries
- Smart formatting in summaries and views
- Anomaly detection grounded in real context

And soon? It will unlock full composition.

## ➡️ What’s Next: Combine and Compose

You’ve got streams. You’ve got reference meaning. Now, let’s wire them together.

In the next step, you’ll learn how to define relationships explicitly. You’ll:

- Join tables using promoted schema
- Save common logic as reusable Functions
- Build a live surface that updates in real time

Let’s turn fragments of structure into a full conversation model.
