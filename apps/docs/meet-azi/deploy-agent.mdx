# Deploy Your First Agent

Your schema is live. Now let’s make the system respond to it.

## Understand the Agent’s Job

You just promoted a schema. Now it’s time to test whether the system truly listens.

An agent is a unit of logic that responds to structure — not just data:

- It listens for specific **impulses** (from promoted schemas)
- It connects to external **state** (through other schemas)
- It only acts when meaning is clear

Let’s break that down.

Your promoted `TemperatureSensor` schema looks like this:

```json
{
  "ID": "temperature-sensor-001",
  "Temperature": 84.2
}
```

Now we’ll promote a schema for your fan controller:

```json
{
  "ID": { "source": "connectionId", "type": "string", "primary": true },
  "Power": { "type": "string", "enum": ["on", "off"] }
}
```

This lets your agent understand not just what the temperature *is* — but what the fan is *already doing*.

That’s how logic becomes **context-aware**.

> You’re not writing an if-statement.
> You’re defining a reflex — scoped by structure, governed by schema.

---

## Define Your First Agent

Let’s build your first agent — one that listens to your schema and responds in real time.
You’ve already defined the structure. Now, let’s define the behavior.

```ts
export default Agent()
  .Impulse(TemperatureSensorSchema)
  .Schemas(ctx => ({
    Fan: ctx.Connect(FanControllerSchema, "fan-controller-001", State.Current)
  }))
  .OnImpulse(async (impulse, ctx) => {
    const fan = ctx.Schemas.Fan;

    if (impulse.Temperature > 80 && fan.Power !== "on") {
      await fan.Commands.Power("on");
      return ctx.Status.Success("Fan turned on");
    }

    if (impulse.Temperature <= 80 && fan.Power !== "off") {
      await fan.Commands.Power("off");
      return ctx.Status.Success("Fan turned off");
    }

    return ctx.Status.Success("No action needed");
  });
```

This logic isn’t a loop. It’s a reflex.
Each part binds intent to structure:
- `.Impulse` listens
- `.Schemas` connects context
- `.OnImpulse` defines behavior

You’ve built a single-schema reflex. Next, you’ll compose behavior across context-bound memories.

## This Is When the System Listens

You’ve defined structure. You’ve written logic. Now it’s time to find out if the system truly respects both.

This is your first deployment — the moment when authored meaning becomes **active behavior**.

But it’s not a function. Not a poller. Not a service waiting in a loop.

An agent only activates when:
- The **structure is promoted**
- The **impulse matches**
- The **execution surface is listening**

This is what makes the system **governed, intentional, and safe**.

> If nothing matches, nothing runs.  
> If meaning is confirmed — the system acts.

---

## Activate the Agent

Open your **Agents** tab and click **Create New Agent**.

- Name it `FanControlAgent`
- Paste in your logic
- Bind it to `TemperatureSensor`
- Choose your surface (e.g., `dev-surface-01`)
- Click **Deploy**

That’s it — no wiring, no polling, no pipelines. You’ve just activated structure-bound behavior.  
That’s it — no wiring, no polling, no pipelines. Logic is now live.

<aside class="border-l-4 border-neon-blue pl-4 italic text-neon-blue">
✅ <code>FanControlAgent</code> deployed to <code>dev-surface-01</code>. I’ll track each time it runs — and why.
</aside>

An execution surface is more than a runtime — it’s a scope of intent. You define structure, bind behavior, and shape what happens inside.

---

## Observe the System Respond

Now let’s test the reflex. When a real `TemperatureSensor` input flows in:

```json
{
  "ID": "temperature-sensor-001",
  "Temperature": 84.2
}
```

This matches your agent’s declared logic. Azi reacts — visibly and precisely.

    Deploy your agent to begin responding to live impulses.

```txt
🔹 Impulse received: Temperature = 84.2
🔸 Agent matched: FanControlAgent

Every agent response is visible in your run logs. You can explore inputs, decisions, and outcomes.

### ✅ System Check

- ✅ Agent matched: `TemperatureSensor`
- ✅ Context fetched: `fan-controller-001`
- ✅ Action taken: `Power = on`
- ✅ Outcome logged and visible

---

## What Just Happened

- The agent responded to a promoted schema
- It ran logic and issued a real command
- Azi tracked everything end-to-end

<aside class="border-l-4 border-neon-blue pl-4 italic text-neon-blue">
If no schema match occurs, nothing runs. Azi logs the impulse — but your agent stays silent. That’s how we protect intent.

  <strong>Impulse → Logic → Action.</strong><br />
  Every execution is traceable. Every decision is explainable.
</div>

<aside class="border-l-4 border-neon-blue pl-4 italic text-neon-blue">
Only <strong>promoted schemas</strong> can trigger logic. That’s how we maintain meaning — and precision.
</aside>

Execution didn’t happen because code was present — it happened because **structure matched**.

<aside class="border-l-4 border-neon-blue pl-4 italic text-neon-blue">
FanControlAgent doesn’t loop or watch a queue. It waits silently — until structure confirms it’s valid. That’s how the system ensures execution only happens when meaning is clear.

## What’s Next

This was your first working agent. But agents are just the beginning.

Soon, you'll:
- Link multiple schemas with `RoomState` or `Schedule`
- Add reasoning or OpenAI explanations to logic
- Deploy to SubSurfaces for scoped test/observe flows

From here, you can:

- Fork agents to test new logic
- Version and preview changes safely
- Chain behaviors across schemas
