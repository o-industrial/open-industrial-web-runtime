# Command the Simulation

You’ve composed structure. Now it’s time to influence behavior.

This is your first outbound **Impulse**—and the moment the system starts evolving with you.

> _"Impulses let you trigger change. When I see the system shift, I raise a Signal to adapt."_ —Azi

In this section, you’ll send a command to the simulation that updates a virtual device’s configuration. Specifically, you'll modify its `CapturedSensors` to include `Humidity`. Once that change lands, the device begins streaming new data. Azi notices the difference, raises a **Signal**, and asks if this new structure should become part of your shared schema.

This is how execution becomes evolution.

## What’s an Impulse? (vs. a Signal)

Think of **Impulses** as intentional triggers. You send them to provoke a system change.

**Signals**, on the other hand, are how the system talks back—surfacing observed changes and asking what to do next.

Here’s the loop you’re stepping into:
1. **Impulse out** — you change device behavior
2. **Structure change** — new fields begin streaming in
3. **Signal raised** — Azi detects the change and proposes an update

This isn’t just messaging. It’s collaboration.

## Update the Simulation

Let’s activate the humidity sensor.

This change is done by updating the `CapturedSensors` list of the simulated device.

### Payload
```json
{
  "CapturedSensors": ["Temperature", "Humidity"]
}
```

This tells the simulation: start including `humidity` in the device’s output.

### Send It Through Azi
- Open Azi’s control interface
- Paste in the JSON
- Click **Send Impulse**

> _💡 Azi Tip:_ “I’ll route this to the simulation agent. If it changes what I see, I’ll let you know.”

### Or Use the CLI
```bash
oictl impulse send --target device01 --payload '{"CapturedSensors": ["Temperature", "Humidity"]}'
```

### Or Use the API
```http
POST /api/impulse
{
  "target": "device01",
  "payload": {
    "CapturedSensors": ["Temperature", "Humidity"]
  }
}
```

## The System Responds

The moment your Impulse is received:
- The device updates its configuration
- Impulses now include a new `humidity` field:

```json
{
  "temperature": 21.4,
  "humidity": 48.2
}
```

Azi notices.

She highlights the shift and raises a **Signal**:
> _"I see a new field. Should we promote it?"_

That’s not just monitoring—it’s participation.

---

## Why This Matters

You’re not configuring a dashboard.
You’re shaping a system.

This is your first full loop of **schema-led execution**:
- **Intent** via Impulse
- **Adaptation** via observed structure
- **Collaboration** via Azi’s raised Signal

The execution surface just became two-way.

## Next Step: Promote the New Field

You just changed the system—from the outside in.

By updating the sensors, you didn’t just toggle a setting. You reshaped the stream. And Azi caught it.

She saw a new field. She raised a Signal. Now she’s asking:  
> _“Should we make this part of how I understand the world?”_

This isn’t a new document. It’s the next beat in the same conversation.

In the next step, you’ll walk side-by-side with Azi to promote `humidity`—turning a raw reading into a first-class field in your evolving schema. Once you do, it’s not just data anymore. It’s shared meaning.

Let’s go teach her.
