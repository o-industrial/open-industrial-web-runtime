# Ask Your First Question

You just promoted a schema. That wasn’t a setting—it was a **Signal**. A signal that told Azi: *“This structure matters.”* And now, that signal is about to answer back.

This page is your first real moment of collaboration. You’ll ask Azi a natural-language question, and she’ll turn it into structured, real-time execution—powered by the schema you made official.

You’ll:

- Try hands-on questions
- See live answers in multiple formats
- Guide Azi when she needs clarification
- And start saving logic you want to reuse

Let’s unlock the insight you just enabled.

## 💡 What Happens When You Ask

When you type a question into Azi, she doesn’t guess. She executes.

Azi reads your question, interprets it through the schema you promoted, and builds a real-time query from the live impulse stream. Then she returns structured results—instantly.

Because you taught her the shape of your world, she can now reason about it.

> *“What’s the average temperature?”*
>
> *“What changed today?”*
>
> *“Was there a spike in flow this morning?”*

These aren’t search terms—they’re operational logic.

## 🔍 Try It Yourself

Ask any of the following of Azi:

- “What’s the average temperature?”
- “What changed today?”
- “Show me pressure by line”
- “Was there a spike in flow this morning?”

Azi parses intent. She routes it through structure. Then she runs it—live.

> 📌 *These work because your schema made terms like ******************`temperature`******************, ******************`line`******************, and ******************`timestamp`****************** part of her language.*

## 📊 How You’ll See the Answer

Azi picks the clearest format based on what you asked:

- **Summary** – For single values or quick facts
- **Chart** – For time trends, comparisons, or ranges
- **Table** – For breakdowns by category, line, or shift

Everything is up-to-the-moment. Everything comes from your data. Azi doesn’t just show you answers—she generates them.

## 🤔 When Azi Needs Clarification

If a term is ambiguous or unfamiliar, Azi will ask you for help. For example:

> *“Did you mean temperature in Celsius or Fahrenheit?”*

You can clarify your meaning—or teach her a new reference.

Each clarification improves future questions. You’re co-evolving a smarter execution model.

> 💬 *Azi Tip: “If I ask for help, it means I want to get it right next time.”*

## 🔁 Save It. Share It. Execute Again.

Once you ask a question that works, it’s not just a one-off.

- Save the logic as a **Function** — a named query you or others can reuse
- Save the output as a **View** — a persistent layout you can return to or embed
- Save the result as a **Schema** — a new structure Azi can validate and monitor over time
- Backfill historical data — Azi can retroactively apply this logic to previous streams and surface trends you may have missed

These become part of your shared execution surface.

> 📦 *Functions and Views help you turn questions into tools.*

## 🧠 What You Just Did

✅ You asked your first real question.

✅ Azi translated it into execution.&#x20;

✅ You saw your system respond, live.&#x20;

✅ You now have the power to name, reuse, and evolve that logic.

This isn’t dashboarding. It’s composing a system that learns with you.

## ➡️ What’s Next: Add Reference Data

The more context Thinky has, the smarter she becomes.

Up next, we’ll show you how to enrich her understanding by adding reference data—things like line mappings, device tags, and operational hierarchies.

Let’s deepen the signal.
