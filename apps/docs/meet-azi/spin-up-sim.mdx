# Spin Up the Sim

> _This isn’t a dashboard. This is your first co-created system._

You’re sitting in your `hello‑azi` workspace—clean, live, and waiting for your signal.  
No prebuilt dashboards. No magic wizards. Just you, Azi, and the raw flow of data.

## Welcome to Your Workspace

This is your personal sandbox—**no** dashboards, **no** scripts, **all** potential.

## Add Your First Data Connections

Click **Add Connection** to open the simulator bank:

1. Temperature Simulator → **ID:** `temperature-sensor-001`
2. Humidity Simulator → **ID:** `humidity-sensor-001` (leave paused)
3. Fan Controller → **ID:** `fan-controller-001`

> 💡 **Thinky Tip:** You’re not inventing data—you’re naming what you connect. Schema is how Azi understands them.

## Create Your First Surface

A Surface is a live execution lens — a named window into selected connections where Azi observes, proposes, and eventually acts.

Now that your simulators are connected, it's time to give Azi a place to observe them.

Click **Create Surface**, name it something like `climate-control`, and select the devices you want to observe:

1. `temperature-sensor-001`
2. `fan-controller-001`

As soon as you confirm, Azi begins listening.

Data will start **spilling onto your surface in real time**, no additional setup required.

You’re not scripting behavior. You’re crafting a space where behavior begins to emerge.

---

## Watch Live Impulses

<figure class="my-8 flex flex-col items-start text-left">
  <img
    data-eac-bypass-base
    src="/assets/first-execution-live-connections.png"
    alt="Azi chat interface showing live streaming data on a surface"
    class="rounded-xl shadow-xl ring-1 ring-indigo-400/30 w-full max-w-md"
  />
  <figcaption class="mt-4 text-sm text-indigo-300 tracking-wide uppercase">
    Live impulses from connected simulators streaming into your surface
  </figcaption>
</figure>

In the **Stream View**, you’ll see lines like:

```json
{
  "deviceId": "temperature-sensor-001",
  "temperature": 72.4,
  "timestamp": "2025-04-22T15:02:00Z"
}
```

Each is an **Impulse** — a single signal Azi processes in real time.

But you don’t just watch impulses flow. You can talk to Azi about them.

Ask Azi:

> "What’s changing most frequently on this surface?"  
> "Which field looks like it might be a status code?"

She won’t just return answers — she’ll dynamically write, execute, and visualize **live probe queries** in response to your questions.

Ask about variability, correlation, or confidence — and Azi might light up a graph, highlight a volatile field, or surface an emergent pattern from the stream.

> _She’s not just reporting. She’s testing hypotheses — and showing you what she sees._

This is dynamic exploration — **conversational, contextual, and visual** — with no SQL or scripting required.

## Provisional Structure Emerges

<figure class="my-8 flex flex-col items-start text-left">

  />
  <figcaption class="mt-4 text-sm text-cyan-300 tracking-wide uppercase">
    Raw JSON on the left. Azi’s evolving schema understanding on the right
  </figcaption>
</figure>

As Azi sees more impulses, she begins to sketch her **Provisional Structure**:

```json
{
  "deviceId": "string",
  "temperature": "number",
  "timestamp": "datetime"
}
```

> _Nothing is saved yet. Meaning is taking form._

You can also ask:

> “What fields are you least confident about?”  
> “Which fields change together most often?”

Azi will begin to surface **structural confidence** and **field correlations** — showing you what she’s still unsure about.

---

## Handling Uncertainty

As more data flows — possibly `status` flipping types or `location` appearing — Azi will prompt:

> “I see a new field: `status`.  
> Do you want me to track both formats or normalize?”

You’ll see the proposed update appear in the schema preview panel — with a confirm or reject option beside it. Azi won’t commit until you accept the format.

> _And yes, you can ask her directly: “What’s your preferred guess for status?”_

The loop is live, conversational, and always permissioned. You’re still in charge — Azi is just thinking out loud.

---

## Cross the Threshold

Promoting a schema makes it real — it becomes part of your workspace memory.  
You’ll be able to build logic against it in the next step.

> _Promoted schemas can evolve — you’ll be able to fork, refine, or retire them later._  
> _Nothing is locked. But everything is tracked._

You could keep watching. Let the structure drift, fade, reform.  
But nothing becomes memory — until you choose.  
_Confirmation is authorship._

> _Promote too early, and you might codify noise. Wait too long, and the pattern might shift beyond recognition._  
> _Azi watches — but only you decide what becomes real._

This surface won’t just show data — it will host your behavior.  
You’ll soon bind logic to these signals and define how your system thinks.

> _This is Signal-Confirmed Execution in motion. Azi observes, proposes, and waits — until you make it real._

> _You’re not writing logic yet — but everything that comes next builds on these impulses. Soon, you’ll declare how your system reacts._

---

You’ve now stepped into the execution loop:  
**Impulse → Schema →** _(Promotion...)_ **→ Logic → Signal → Evolution**  
The first two steps are complete. Promotion is next.

You’ve just spun up a real, interactive world — no downloads, no scripts — just you and Azi co-creating a living system.

> _This simulator streams live — but nothing is stored unless you bind it to a memory surface or logic path._

> _You didn’t just connect data. You created a system that waits for your signal._  
> **This isn’t a dashboard. This is your system, listening.**
