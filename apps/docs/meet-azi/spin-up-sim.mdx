# Spin Up the Sim

<SystemMindset intentType={IntentTypes.Primary}>
  This isn’t a dashboard. This is your first co-created system.
</SystemMindset>

You’re sitting in your `hello‑azi` workspace—clean, live, and waiting for your signal.  
No prebuilt dashboards. No magic wizards. Just you, Azi, and the raw flow of data.

---

## Welcome to Your Workspace

<FigureImage
  src="/assets/screenshots/first-execution-hello-azi-welcome.png"
  alt="hello-azi workspace"
  caption="The clean, pre‑provisioned hello-azi workspace—ready for you to begin"
  intentType={IntentTypes.Info}
  glow
  size="xl"
  shadow="2xl"
/>

This is your personal sandbox—**no** dashboards, **no** scripts, **all** potential.

---

## Add Your First Data Connections

Drag the top-left node — <strong>Connection</strong> — onto the canvas:

<FigureImage
  src="/assets/screenshots/hello-azi-connection-node.png"
  alt="Connection node in the left-hand node bank"
  caption="Drag the Connection node to create a new connection."
  intentType={IntentTypes.Info}
  glow
  shadow="2xl"
/>

Once dropped, the Inspector panel opens automatically:

<FigureImage

  alt="Inspector panel open for a dropped connection node"
  caption="After dropping a connection, name it in the Inspector panel."
  intentType={IntentTypes.Info}
  glow
  shadow="2xl"
/>

Name your three connections:

1. Temperature Simulator → <code>temperature-sensor-001</code>  
2. Humidity Simulator → <code>humidity-sensor-001</code> (leave paused)  
3. Fan Controller → <code>fan-controller-001</code>

<InlineUXTip intentType={IntentTypes.Info}>
  You’re not inventing data — you’re naming what Azi will observe. Schema is how she understands them.
</InlineUXTip>

---

## Add Simulated Data Sources

Click the flask icon in the bottom-left corner to open the Simulator Library:

<FigureImage
  src="/assets/screenshots/hello-azi-simulator-button.png"
  alt="Simulator library button in lower-left corner of canvas"
  caption="Click to open the Simulator Library."
  intentType={IntentTypes.Info}
  glow
  size="auto"
  shadow="2xl"
/>

Inside the library, search for the <code>hello-azi</code> pack:

<FigureImage
  src="/assets/screenshots/hello-azi-simulator-library.png"
  alt="Simulator library modal open showing hello-azi pack"
  caption="Use the hello-azi pack to load the correct test simulators."
  intentType={IntentTypes.Info}
  glow
  shadow="2xl"
/>

Drag each simulator from the left side and connect it to the appropriate data connection:

<FigureImage
  src="/assets/screenshots/hello-azi-simulator-connected.png"
  alt="Three simulators connected to three data connections"
  caption="Your simulator layout: left side simulators, right side data connections."
  intentType={IntentTypes.Info}
  glow
  shadow="2xl"
/>

---

## Create a Surface

Next, bring everything together by placing a surface on the canvas.

Drag the **Surface** node from the node bank and place it to the right of your data connections:

<FigureImage
  src="/assets/screenshots/hello-azi-surface-node.png"
  alt="Surface node in the left-hand node bank"
  caption="Drag the Surface node onto the canvas — this is where structure becomes memory."
  intentType={IntentTypes.Info}
  glow
  shadow="2xl"
/>

Then connect all your data connections to the surface. This is the structure Azi will observe from — and soon, where you’ll promote your first schema.

---

## Save Your System State

Before impulses begin flowing, your graph must be saved.

Look to the top-right corner of your canvas — you’ll see a save icon:

<FigureImage
  src="/assets/screenshots/save-button-changes.png"
  alt="Save icon in unsaved state (pink)"
  caption="When your graph has unsaved changes, the save icon turns pink."
  intentType={IntentTypes.Warning}
  size="auto"
  glow
  shadow="2xl"
/>

Once saved, it will return to its default blue color:

<FigureImage
  src="/assets/screenshots/save-button-no-changes.png"
  alt="Save icon in saved state (blue)"
  caption="After saving, the icon returns to blue."
  intentType={IntentTypes.Secondary}
  size="auto"
  glow
  shadow="2xl"
/>

Hover over the save icon to unlock powerful controls:

<FigureImage
  src="/assets/screenshots/full-management-controls.png"
  alt="Save, fork, undo, redo, and revert controls shown on hover"
  caption="Hovering the save icon reveals version and history controls — fork, undo, redo, and revert."
  intentType={IntentTypes.Info}
  glow
  shadow="2xl"
/>

<InlineUXTip intentType={IntentTypes.Info}>
  Saving locks in your changes. Hover the icon to explore version history and forking — your system state is fully traceable.
</InlineUXTip>

<ThematicPrincipleBlock intentType={IntentTypes.Primary}>
  <strong>Saving is the moment memory begins.</strong><br />
  Azi proposes. You accept. Your system evolves.
</ThematicPrincipleBlock>

## Watch Live Impulses

<FigureImage
  src="/assets/screenshots/hello-azi-surface-connected.png"
  alt="Workspace graph with connections, simulators, and surface attached"
  caption="Once saved, impulses begin flowing across the graph."
  intentType={IntentTypes.Info}
  glow
  shadow="2xl"
/>

<InlineUXTip intentType={IntentTypes.Info}>
  Single-click a node to preview inline data. Double-click to open the Inspector and see live signals.
</InlineUXTip>

<FigureImage
  src="/assets/screenshots/hello-azi-live-impulse-stream.png"
  alt="Live impulse stream showing real-time events flowing across the canvas"
  caption="The live stream view shows incoming impulses from your connected simulators."
  intentType={IntentTypes.Info}
  glow
  shadow="2xl"
/>

<ThematicPrincipleBlock intentType={IntentTypes.Secondary}>
  You’ve begun the execution loop:<br />
  <strong>Impulse → Schema →</strong> (Promotion…) <strong>→ Logic → Signal → Evolution</strong>
</ThematicPrincipleBlock>

In the stream view, you’ll see impulses like:

```json
{
  "deviceId": "temperature-sensor-001",
  "temperature": 72.4,
  "timestamp": "2025-04-22T15:02:00Z"
}
```

Each one is an <strong>Impulse</strong> — a real-time observation.

Ask Azi:

> "What’s changing most frequently on this surface?"  
> "Which field looks like it might be a status code?"

She won’t just return answers — she’ll dynamically write, execute, and visualize **live probe queries** in response to your questions.

Ask about variability, correlation, or confidence — and Azi might light up a graph, highlight a volatile field, or surface an emergent pattern from the stream.

<AziInnerVoice intentType={IntentTypes.Tertiary}>
  She’s not just reporting. She’s testing hypotheses — and showing you what she sees.
</AziInnerVoice>

<AziInnerVoice intentType={IntentTypes.Tertiary}>
  I see a shape forming — but I won’t remember it until you promote it.
</AziInnerVoice>

This is dynamic exploration — **conversational, contextual, and visual** — with no SQL or scripting required.

<InlineUXTip intentType={IntentTypes.Info}>
  You’ll define a surface — where structure and memory live — in the next step.
</InlineUXTip>

<SystemMindset intentType={IntentTypes.Tertiary}>
  You’ve set the stage. The data is flowing. Azi sees meaning forming. And now she’s waiting for one thing: your signal.
</SystemMindset>
