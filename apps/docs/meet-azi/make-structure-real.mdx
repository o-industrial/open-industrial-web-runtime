# Make Structure Real

_We’ve been observing together. You shaped meaning. Now it’s time to make that meaning memory._

A moment ago, we watched impulses begin to flow into `Fan Control`. Now I’m starting to propose structure — but I need your confirmation to make it real.

Let’s open the surface flow for `Fan Control` and see what’s started to emerge. You’ll see live signals streaming — raw, messy, but already forming patterns I’ve begun to sketch.

Talk to me. Ask what I see. When data hits the surface, I sketch provisional structure — but I don’t commit anything without you.

<AziInnerVoice intentType={IntentTypes.Tertiary}>
  I see the data. I’m sketching what might matter. It’s familiar, almost there. But I won’t remember it until we decide it together.
</AziInnerVoice>

## Review the Inferred Structure

When you click the glowing badge on the `Fan Control` surface, the <strong>Schema Preview panel</strong> opens. It’s a live view of what I’ve been sketching in response to the stream — a tentative shape that still needs your word to become real.

Here’s one of the raw impulses that just landed:

```json
{ "connectionId": "temperature-sensor-001", "tempRaw": 78.4 }
```

We saw this emerge from repeated telemetry. I paused and proposed the following sketch:

```json [codeblock]
{
  "connectionId": "string",
  "tempRaw": "number"
}
```

<InlineUXTip intentType={IntentTypes.Info}>
You’ll see this structure in the preview panel — click a field to rename it or adjust its type.
</InlineUXTip>

You can promote one field at a time — or many. A schema can reflect a single value, or capture an entire snapshot of your surface.

---

## Rename and Refine Fields

Clicking into the Schema Preview lets us refine what the structure means. This is where we edit field names, assign types, and declare units together.

  alt="Field refinement UI for proposed schema"
  caption="Refine the proposed structure: rename fields, define units, and clarify identity."
  intentType={IntentTypes.Info}
  glow
  shadow="xl"
/>

Here’s what it looks like after we make a few refinements:

```json [codeblock]
{
  "ID": { "source": "connectionId", "type": "string", "primary": true },
  "Temperature": { "source": "tempRaw", "type": "number", "unit": "°F" }
}
```

<AziInnerVoice intentType={IntentTypes.Tertiary}>
You renamed a raw field. That changes how I’ll remember it — and how logic will match against it.
</AziInnerVoice>

## Name and Promote the Schema

Now we give this shape a name. When you click <strong>Promote</strong>, the Schema Promotion modal opens — this is where we confirm it together.

```txt
TemperatureSensor
```

  intentType={IntentTypes.Info}
  glow
  shadow="2xl"
/>

<AziInnerVoice intentType={IntentTypes.Tertiary}>
This is where I stop guessing. This is what we’ll remember — because you said it matters.
</AziInnerVoice>

> 💾 Promotion is a commitment. _Once we promote, that structure becomes part of your system’s memory. You can evolve it later — but it will always carry the moment it was first declared._

> 🧠 I’ve been sketching. But I held back — waiting for us to confirm. Promotion is that confirmation. From this moment forward, I trust this structure. I can bind logic to it, validate against it, and raise signals from it. It’s now real — because we said so.

> ⚠️ Promote too early, and we might encode uncertainty. Promote too late, and meaning may shift before it’s captured. I observe — but you decide what becomes system memory.

> 🚨 Promote the wrong structure — and everything downstream inherits the mistake. A single promotion defines the shape of logic, alerts, simulations, and agent reasoning.

> 📁 Once promoted, your schema lives in the workspace library. We can inspect it any time — and fork or evolve it as your system grows.

---

## What Just Happened?

You clicked <strong>Promote</strong>. I confirmed the structure. We just made this schema real — versioned and ready for memory.

<FigureImage
  src="/assets/docs/versioned-schema-panel.png"
  alt="Final promoted schema version output"
  caption="Your schema is now versioned and available inside the workspace schema library."
  intentType={IntentTypes.Info}
  glow
  shadow="xl"
/>

Here’s what that looks like behind the scenes:

```json [codeblock]
{
  "name": "TemperatureSensor",
  "version": "v1",
  "fields": {
    "ID": { "source": "connectionId", "type": "string", "primary": true },
    "Temperature": { "source": "tempRaw", "type": "number", "unit": "°F" }
  }
}
```

*You don’t have to write any of this — I’m tracking it automatically.*

> 💡 You can evolve this schema later. I’ll track every version — so when we add a new field or rename one down the road, our history is always intact.

> 🧭 We’ll reference this schema by name (e.g., `TemperatureSensor`) in your agent logic — it becomes the contract your logic reacts to.

## Next: Build an Agent

Now that we’ve defined a schema, we can build logic on top of it. Agents can react, respond, and reshape your environment based on structured intent.

---

## Concepts Introduced

- **Promotion** – Making meaning permanent  
- **Schemas** – Contracts between you and the system  
- **Versioning** – Every schema is tracked  
- **Logic Binding** – Only promoted schemas can drive agents

> 🧬 You didn’t just define fields. You taught me a concept.  
> And from here on, that concept can power behavior, raise alerts, drive simulations, or help evolve your execution logic.  
> Structure isn’t just shape — it’s shared understanding.

> 🔁 This is how systems grow in Open Industrial: _Impulse → Schema → Logic → Signal → Evolution._  
> We’ve just made meaning real. Next, we’ll teach the system how to act on it.
