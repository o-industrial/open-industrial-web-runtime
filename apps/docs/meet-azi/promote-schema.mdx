# Promote Your First Schema

_You watched live data flow. You shaped meaning. Now it’s time to commit that meaning to memory._

This is your first act of authorship. You’re about to promote meaning — to transform live data structure into lasting memory.

> 🛠️ You’ll do this directly in the schema promotion panel inside the workspace UI — no code or CLI required.

---

## Review the Inferred Structure

Before we show you the shape, here’s what Azi actually saw — a real impulse from your simulator:

```json
{ "connectionId": "temperature-sensor-001", "tempRaw": 78.4 }
```

She recognized the pattern. And instead of acting, she asked:

> _“Should I remember this?”_

Azi proposed the following structure:

**[Editable Schema Preview]**
```json [codeblock]
{
  "ID": { "source": "connectionId", "type": "string", "primary": true },
  "Temperature": { "source": "tempRaw", "type": "number", "unit": "°F" }
}
```

She’s not just parsing JSON — she’s proposing structure. She’s mapping raw data into semantic fields. And before committing anything to memory, she defers to you.

---

## Rename and Refine Fields

You can accept Azi’s proposal as-is — or rename fields to better reflect your system’s intent. For example:

**[Editable Schema Preview]**
```json [codeblock]
{
  "ID": { "source": "connectionId", "type": "string", "primary": true },
  "Temperature": { "source": "tempRaw", "type": "number", "unit": "°F" }
}
```

---

## Name and Promote the Schema

Choose a name for your schema. This creates a reusable, versioned contract. Let’s go with:

```txt
TemperatureSensor
```

Once you confirm, Azi will store this as a versioned schema in your workspace library.

> 💾 Promotion is a commitment. _Once promoted, a schema becomes part of your system’s memory. You can evolve it later — but it will always carry the moment it was first declared._

> 🧠 Until now, Azi has been observing. But she’s held back — waiting for confirmation. Promotion is that confirmation. From this moment forward, she **trusts** this structure. She can bind logic to it, validate against it, and raise signals from it. It’s now real — because you said so.

> ⚠️ Promote too early, and you might encode uncertainty. Promote too late, and meaning may shift before it’s captured. Azi observes — but you decide what becomes system memory.

> 🚨 Promote the wrong structure — and everything downstream inherits the mistake. A single promotion defines the shape of logic, alerts, simulations, and agent reasoning.

> 📁 Once promoted, your schema lives in the workspace library. You can inspect it at any time — and fork or evolve it when your system grows.

## What Just Happened?

You’ve now promoted a schema. Azi will version it, track changes, and enable it for downstream logic. Only promoted schemas can power agents.

> 🔁 This is Signal-Confirmed Execution in motion — logic only emerges once structure is confirmed.

**[Final Promoted Output]**
```json [codeblock]
{
  "name": "TemperatureSensor",
  "version": "v1",
  "fields": {
    "ID": { "source": "connectionId", "type": "string", "primary": true },
    "Temperature": { "source": "tempRaw", "type": "number", "unit": "°F" }
  }
}
```

> 💡 You can evolve this schema later. Azi will track every version — so when you add a new field or rename one down the road, your history is always intact.

> 🧭 You’ll reference this schema by name (e.g., `TemperatureSensor`) in your agent logic — it becomes the contract your logic reacts to.

## Next: Build an Agent

Now that you’ve defined a schema, you can build logic on top of it. Agents can react, respond, and reshape your environment based on structured intent.

---

## Concepts Introduced

- **Promotion** – Making meaning permanent  
- **Schemas** – Contracts between you and the system  
- **Versioning** – Every schema is tracked  
- **Logic Binding** – Only promoted schemas can drive agents

> 🧬 You didn’t just define fields. You taught Azi a concept.  
> And from here on, that concept can power behavior, raise alerts, drive simulations, or help evolve your execution logic.  
> Structure isn’t just shape — it’s shared understanding.

> 🔁 This is how systems grow in Open Industrial: _Impulse → Schema → Logic → Signal → Evolution._  
> You’ve just made meaning real. Next, you’ll teach the system how to act on it.
