# Evolve Together

> *"You version your agent. The system adapts."*

Youâ€™ve promoted a smarter schema. Now itâ€™s time to upgrade your logic to matchâ€”and evolve without breaking what already works.

## Fork the Agent

Forking is how you test improvements, compare outcomes, and merge changes safely.

From your Agent panel, click **Fork Agent** on `FanControlAgent`. Name the new fork `FanControlAgent v2`.

This fork will run alongside the original until you're ready to promote it.

> *Forking doesnâ€™t break history. It gives you safe space to grow.*

## Bind to RoomState

Update your agent to respond to the latest version of `RoomState`. Azi will bind you to `RoomState v1.2`, which now includes:
- Temperature + DesiredTemp
- Humidity + HumidityThreshold
- FanPower
- Room context

This lets your agent reason in full environmental contextâ€”across multiple rooms. No hardcoding required.

```ts
export default Agent()
  .Impulse(RoomStateSchema)
  .Tools({
    Explain: async (room, powerMode) => {
      const openai = new OpenAI();

      return await openai.chat.completions.create({
        model: "gpt-4",
        messages: [
          {
            role: "user",
            content: `Explain why the fan was turned ${powerMode}. Temperature was ${room.Temperature}Â°F (threshold ${room.DesiredTemp}), humidity was ${room.Humidity}% (threshold ${room.HumidityThreshold}), room was ${room.Room}.`
          }
        ]
      });
    }
  })
  .OnImpulse(async (room, ctx) => {
    if (
      room.Temperature > room.DesiredTemp &&
      room.Humidity > room.HumidityThreshold &&
      room.FanPower !== "on"
    ) {
      await room.Commands.Fan.Power("on");
      const explanation = await ctx.Tools.Explain(room, "on");
      return ctx.Status.Success(explanation);
    }

    if (
      room.Temperature < room.DesiredTemp * 0.9 &&
      room.Humidity < room.HumidityThreshold * 0.9 &&
      room.FanPower !== "off"
    ) {
      await room.Commands.Fan.Power("off");
      const explanation = await ctx.Tools.Explain(room, "off");
      return ctx.Status.Success(explanation);
    }

    return ctx.Status.Success("No action needed");
  });
```

This logic:
- Responds to live composite state
- Runs across **any room**
- Adds multi-dimensional logic for temperature + humidity
- Explains its actions in natural language via OpenAI

> *ðŸ’¡ Thinky Tip: Youâ€™re not hardcoding responsesâ€”youâ€™re shaping behavior with structure.*

## Safely Compare Agents

Deploying both agents to the same surface would cause execution conflictsâ€”two logic units trying to control the same fan. Instead, youâ€™ll compare `v2` in a controlled, observable way.

### Create a SubSurface for Evaluation

From your `Main` surface, create a **SubSurface**.
- Inherit all three connections from Main
- Reconfigure `fan-controller-001` in this SubSurface:
  - Set **Command Mode** to **Mocked**
  - Azi will record what the agent *would* have done, without sending real commands

*Caption: A forked SubSurface for testing new agent logic safely.*

### Deploy `FanControlAgent v2` to SubSurface

Now add your new agent to the SubSurface.
It will run normally, respond to real impulses, and log its intentâ€”without affecting real-world behavior.

> *ðŸ’¡ Thinky Tip: A mocked command still reflects real logic. Azi just doesnâ€™t act on it... yet.*

### Observe and Compare

Azi shows you:
- When `v2` would have acted
- What explanation it generated
- How that compares to what `v1` actually did

You can also add a helper agent to the SubSurface that:
- Observes both agent outputs
- Highlights decision differences
- Logs a side-by-side impulse result comparison

> *ðŸ’¡ Thinky Tip: Real evolution isnâ€™t guessingâ€”itâ€™s guided observation.*

## Promote the Evolution

Once youâ€™re confident `v2` behaves correctly:
- Retire `v1` from the `Main` surface
- Reconfigure `fan-controller-001` back to **real command mode**
- Deploy `v2` to Main

Now, the surface runs only the evolved logicâ€”with confidence.

Azi keeps the full historyâ€”so you can fork again, roll back, or evolve further.

Once youâ€™re confident `v2` behaves correctly:
- Unassign `FanControlAgent`
- Promote `v2` to mainline

The surface now runs only the evolved agent.

Azi keeps the full historyâ€”so you can fork again, roll back, or evolve further.
