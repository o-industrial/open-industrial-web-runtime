# Promote Your First Schema

You just hit **Promote Schema**. That wasn’t a setting—it was a **Signal** in your system.

You told Azi: “This structure matters.” That signal now echoes across your execution surface—informing validation, guiding suggestions, and shaping how your system adapts.

Let’s walk through what you’ve unlocked—and how to build on it right now.

### 🧠 Step 1: See What You Just Promoted

Azi now treats this structure as canonical. That means she’s no longer inferring—she’s understanding. This schema is now a recognized entity in your system, with a name, a version, and a purpose.

👆 **What you do:**
- Click **Edit** to adjust field names, data types, or add descriptions
- Use the **Metadata** tab to annotate each field with domain-specific context: what it represents, why it matters, or what values to expect

> ✨ _Try it now: Add a description to `status_code` like “Device health indicator, where 0 = OK and 1 = Warning.”_

Adding metadata helps Azi:
- Answer questions more precisely
- Offer smarter suggestions for views, filters, and agents
- Explain results in your own domain terms

✳️ This is your first formal schema. Versioned. Trustable. Shared—and ready to evolve.

### ✳️ Step 2: What Promotion Unlocks

Promoting a schema turns draft understanding into operational truth.

Now Azi will:
- Validate incoming data against this schema
- Detect structural drift over time
- Suggest visualizations, logic flows, and monitoring options

📌 Schema is now language—something your system can speak, verify, and act upon.

👨‍🔬 **Try This: Trigger a Schema Violation**

Open the **HTTP Interface Form** and submit data with a mismatched field—like sending `timestamp: "yesterday"` instead of an ISO date.

> 🖼️ *Screenshot Placeholder: HTTP form with invalid payload and Azi response*

Azi will surface the issue immediately:
- Highlighting the violation in the payload
- Referencing the promoted schema
- Offering guidance (e.g., "Expected a valid ISO date")

💡 *Azi Tip:* "If something breaks schema, I’ll let you know right away. That’s how we keep execution clean—and learning sharp."

### 🔗 Step 3: Explore Next Actions

With your schema promoted, you’ll see new options immediately:

> 🖼️ *Screenshot Placeholder: "What can I do next?" panel with Suggested View, New Agent, Monitor Drift options*

👆 **What you do:**
- Click **Suggest a View** to explore chart and table layouts
- Click **New Agent** to define logic powered by this shape
- Click **Monitor Stream** to start watching for anomalies or drift

💡 *Azi Tip:* “Schemas help me reason about change. Want me to alert you if this structure shifts?”

---

### 💬 Step 4: Ask a Real Question

Now that Azi understands the shape of your world, ask a question.

> “What’s the average pressure on Line B this week?”

✅ If you got an answer back—congrats. Schema promotion worked.

👆 **What happens:**
- Azi maps `pressure_kpa` as a metric
- Filters by `line == "B"`
- Time-slices using `timestamp`

She responds—like someone fluent in your domain.

### ✨ What You Just Did

🎯 Your next moves:
- Save a visual view
- Define a new agent
- Watch for structure drift
- Or just keep streaming—Azi’s learning every second

📌 Why this matters:
- You formalized structure without writing a line of code
- Azi’s no longer guessing—she’s interpreting
- You’ve created a foundation for execution, not just insight

**Let’s keep going. Azi’s ready.**
