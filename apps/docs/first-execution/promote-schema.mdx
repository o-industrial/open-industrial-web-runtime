# Promote the Schema

> *"You formalize meaning. Azi remembers."*

A moment ago, you watched Azi observe raw telemetry and propose structure. Now itâ€™s time to respondâ€”not with configuration, but with confirmation.

## What Azi Saw

Based on repeated impulses like this:

```json
{ "connectionId": "temperature-sensor-001", "tempRaw": 78.4 }
```

Azi proposed the following structure:

```json
{
  "ID": { "source": "connectionId", "type": "string", primary: true },
  "Temperature": { "source": "tempRaw", "type": "number", "unit": "Â°F" }
}
```

Sheâ€™s not just parsing JSONâ€”sheâ€™s noticing patterns. And before she does anything with them, she asks:

> *"Should I remember this?"*

This is the first moment where **observation becomes understanding**.

## Promote the Schema

Click **Promote Schema** to begin confirming structure.

Youâ€™ll walk through:

- Reviewing the proposed fields and types
- Optionally renaming fields (e.g., `TemperatureRaw` â†’ `Temperature`)
- Giving the schema a name: `TemperatureSensor`
- Letting Azi version it automatically (e.g., `v1`)


*Caption: Promote structure and name your first schema.*

Once confirmed:

- The schema appears in your workspaceâ€™s schema library
- Azi treats it as a canonical shape
- You can now use it to bind logic or compose with others

Youâ€™ve just taken raw data and turned it into shared structure.

## Why This Changes Everything

Promoting a schema isnâ€™t about configuration. Itâ€™s about **declaring what matters**.

Once a schema is promoted:

- The Surface begins showing typed records
- Azi starts routing logic using this shared language
- Agents and tools downstream now recognize this structure by name

> *ðŸ’¡ Thinky Tip: Youâ€™re not configuring fields. Youâ€™re teaching structure.*

Youâ€™ve taken the first step toward building a system that understands.

Next: [Create the Agent] â†’ Youâ€™ll write logic that reacts to this newly promoted schema.
