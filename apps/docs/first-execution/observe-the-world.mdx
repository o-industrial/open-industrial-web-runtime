# Observe Your First Impulse

> *"Let’s try something together. I’ve got a little device I can spin up for you. It streams just enough data to get us started. Ready?"*

Meet Azi—in action.

This isn’t just an introduction. It’s your first working session.

Click **Start Simulator** to launch a virtual sensor. (Don’t worry—nothing to install.)

Then sit back and watch—Azi’s already paying attention.

The stream begins with a few simple fields:

- `temperature`
- `deviceId`
- `status`

After a moment, the data evolves:

- `location` starts showing up (as a string, then a lat/long pair)
- `vibration` kicks in
- `uptime` appears, sometimes as seconds, sometimes formatted as a string
- `status` starts flipping between numbers and strings

    Azi notices structure shifting—like <code>status</code> changing type

> *Azi says:* "Hmm, looks like `status` is coming in two formats. Want me to track both—or normalize them to something consistent?"

You’re watching her learn in real time.

On one side, raw JSON. On the other, Azi’s structured view.
Fields appear, types shift, structure stabilizes.

And when she feels confident:

> \_"Looks like a pattern is forming. Want to promote this schema?"

Click **Promote Schema** to make this structure official—for now. You can always change or version it later. Promotion is just how you and Azi agree on what matters.

  <figcaption class="mt-4 text-sm text-purple-300 tracking-wide uppercase">
    Click Promote to confirm the structure Azi has proposed

Now try asking a question:

**You:** *"What’s the average temperature?"*\
**Azi:** *"Last 2 minutes? Around 72.4°F."*

    Ask Azi a question—she responds from structured understanding

No setup. No scripting. Just structured understanding, unfolding as you explore.

**Azi Tip:**

> *"I learn faster when data flows steadily. Let’s keep this going for a few minutes if you can."*

## What’s Next?

Now that you’ve observed your first impulse stream and seen Azi learn its shape, it’s time to turn structure into meaning.

> **Next step:** [Promote Your First Schema →](#)

You’ll teach Azi which fields matter—and make this structure official. From there, she’ll:

- Lock in the schema as a canonical version
- Suggest visualizations and track anomalies
- Validate incoming impulses against what you’ve taught her

Once promoted, this schema becomes a shared language. And you’re ready to start asking questions.

Let’s show Azi what matters.
