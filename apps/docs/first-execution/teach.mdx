# Teach Azi a New Field

You just changed the simulation. Azi saw the difference—and now she’s asking if you’d like to make that change part of your shared structure.

Let’s walk through your first schema evolution.

## The Moment of Change

> _“I see a new field: `humidity`. Want to promote it?”_ —Azi

In the previous step, you sent an **Impulse** to the simulation to activate the `humidity` sensor. That triggered a change in the shape of incoming data:

```json
{
  "temperature": 72.1,
  "humidity": 62.5
}
```

Azi compared the new impulse to your current schema. She didn’t break, she didn’t guess—she raised a **Signal**. A gentle ask: _Do you want this to be part of how I understand the world?_

## Promote the New Field

Here’s how to review and confirm the schema evolution.

### 1. View the Updated Impulse

Open the live stream viewer in the Azi interface.

You’ll see `humidity` in the latest data.

### 2. Review the Signal

Azi flags the structural change:

Click **Review** to open the proposed schema update.

### 3. Inspect the Proposed Schema

Azi suggests:

```diff
+ humidity: number
```

She recommends bumping the version from `1.1.0` to `1.1.1`.

You can:

- ✅ **Promote** — accept it
- ✏️ **Edit** — refine the shape or description
- ❌ **Skip** — keep running with the draft

### 4. Promote

Click **Promote**.

Azi finalizes Schema v1.1.1. From this moment on, `humidity` is official.

> 💡 _“Every schema you promote teaches me something. You’re shaping how I see your world.”_ —Azi

## Under the Hood

Here’s how it works:

- Azi compares each incoming impulse to the latest schema
- When drift is detected, she infers a draft
- If the change is non-breaking, she raises a schema evolution Signal. If it’s breaking, she raises a warning Signal with context and fallback options
- Execution continues uninterrupted

This is **zero-downtime schema evolution**.

## You Just Completed the Loop

Let’s recap:

1. You sent an **Impulse** to change behavior
2. Azi received **new structure**
3. She raised a **Signal** to confirm the meaning
4. You promoted the change into shared schema

> Schema isn’t a static config—it’s a living agreement.

## What You’ve Unlocked

Now that `humidity` is part of your schema:

- You can ask questions like:
  > _“What’s the average humidity this hour?”_
- Azi will generate visualizations and trendlines
- You can use `humidity` in Composite Schemas
- You can export and share this structure via Schema Packs

You didn’t just ingest new data. You taught Azi how to understand it.

## What’s Next?

This marks the end of the “Meet Azi” journey—and the beginning of real collaboration.

Your execution surface is now adaptive. Your schema is evolving. And your system is learning from what you teach.

Let’s keep building.
