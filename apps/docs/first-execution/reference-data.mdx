# Add Reference Data

> *"You add context. The agent gets smarter."*

Your agent responded to raw telemetry. Now it’s time to give that data **meaning**.

By introducing reference data, you give Azi—and your agents—a way to understand the world behind the numbers. Devices belong to rooms. Rooms have target conditions. These relationships create context. And context powers reasoning.

## Define the Device Directory Schema

Start by creating a new **reference schema** named `DeviceDirectorySchema`. This defines the structure for describing where devices live and what they represent:

```json
{
  "ID": { "type": "string", "primary": true },
  "FriendlyName": { "type": "string" },
  "Room": { "type": "string" }
}
```

Click **Promote Schema**.

Azi versions this structure automatically and makes it available in your workspace.

## Use Azi’s Auto-Generated View

Once the schema is promoted, Azi creates a fully editable table view:

Now add your reference data:

```json
[
  { "ID": "temperature-sensor-001", "FriendlyName": "Temp Sensor - Lab1", "Room": "Lab1" },
  { "ID": "fan-controller-001", "FriendlyName": "Exhaust Fan - Lab1", "Room": "Lab1" }
]
```

> *💡 Thinky Tip: You define the schema once. Azi gives you the tools to manage it forever.*

## Define the RoomThresholdConfig Schema

Next, define a schema to represent environmental targets per room:

```json
{
  "Room": { "type": "string", "primary": true },
  "DesiredTemp": { "type": "number" }
}
```

Promote this as `RoomThresholdConfigSchema`. Again, Azi versions the structure.

## Populate the RoomThresholdConfig Table

Azi generates a view here too. Enter your data inline:

```json
[
  { "Room": "Lab1", "DesiredTemp": 72 }
]
```

## Why Reference Data Matters

Promoting reference schemas turns structure into something agents can reason with:

- Join telemetry to context: sensors → rooms
- Link rooms to expectations: rooms → thresholds
- Track and version it all: structure + data

Once promoted:
- Azi begins composing schema across data and reference
- Your agents can see more than just numbers—they can see situations

> *💡 Thinky Tip: Reference data is structure. And structure drives behavior.*

## What Azi Starts to See

With these two tables in place, Azi begins noticing relationships:

- That multiple devices belong to the same room
- That thresholds apply per room—not per sensor
- That this context can now be merged into future schema proposals

She doesn’t act yet. But the dots are starting to connect.

Next: [Composite Schema] → You’ll promote a `RoomState` that combines telemetry with thresholds and metadata.
