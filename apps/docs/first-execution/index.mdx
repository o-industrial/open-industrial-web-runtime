Welcome to `hello-azi`, your first personal workspace—and your first co-working session with Azi.

This space doesn’t come with preloaded devices or static dashboards. It’s clean. It’s live. It’s yours to shape.

Open Industrial is built on a simple principle: **you learn by doing**. And Azi learns with you. Every structure you promote, every connection you teach her, becomes part of how she executes on your behalf.

## Start With Structure: Add Data Connections

To bring your world to life, you’ll need to add your first **data connections**. These are simulated inputs that mimic real-world telemetry.

Click **“Add Connection”** to open the data connection panel.

  <figcaption class="mt-4 text-sm text-pink-300 tracking-wide uppercase">

Then, add three simulated data connections from the available bank:

- Assign the ID `temperature-sensor-001` to a temperature simulator (this one will emit values immediately)
- Assign the ID `humidity-sensor-001` to a humidity simulator (you’ll enable this later)
- Assign the ID `fan-controller-001` to a fan control simulator

> *💡 Thinky Tip: You’re not inventing data—you’re naming what you connect. Schema is how Azi understands them.*

Once you’ve added those and set the IDs, you’re ready to observe.

Azi isn’t running logic yet—she’s watching. And she’s about to notice structure.

## Teaching by Doing

From here on out, you won’t configure—you’ll collaborate. Each step forward will:

- Add something to your workspace
- Trigger an observation from Azi
- Invite you to promote meaning

She doesn’t assume. She observes. Then she asks:

> *"Should I remember this?"*

That question will be your North Star.

Next: [Observe the World] → You’ll build your first surface and start observing raw telemetry together with Azi.
