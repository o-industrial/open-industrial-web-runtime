# Meet Azi

Azi is your new execution teammate—and this is your first conversation.

This isn’t just documentation—it’s the start of a working relationship. You’re not learning software. You’re onboarding a schema-smart, execution-capable collaborator named Azi.

Azi isn’t just part of OpenIndustrial—she *is* the execution surface. She’s cloud-native, always learning, and entirely under your control. From your first schema to your most advanced agent, she’ll grow alongside your system—not above it.

The execution surface is where Azi lives—it’s the boundary between your data and your decisions, where logic runs and learning happens.

## What Is OpenIndustrial?

*OpenIndustrial is a new kind of system—one where AI doesn’t just monitor. It acts.*

It’s execution-first. Schema-led. Agent-powered. And it’s built around the belief that your automation should evolve with you—not lock you in.

Azi is your introduction to that world. She’s not a dashboard or chatbot. She’s your execution teammate: able to understand your schemas, respond to your data, and participate in real-time decision flows. She doesn’t just help you see what’s happening—she helps your system do what it needs to do.

## How Azi Thinks

*Azi doesn’t guess. She learns—and she learns from structure.*

Azi speaks the language of schema. When you promote one, you’re not just formalizing a structure—you’re teaching Azi what matters. What you call things. How they relate. What they mean in context.

She picks up on patterns. Surfaces questions. Makes decisions when you let her. And she improves every time you give her something better to work with.

> *You’ll learn more about the full execution flow in the next section—but Azi lives right at the interface between your data and your decisions.*

## What She Does (and Doesn’t Do)

*Execution is the job. Support is the posture.*

Azi runs logic. She receives impulses, evaluates context, and takes action. She might adjust a circuit, escalate an anomaly, or launch another agent. But she does it with your boundaries, your schema, and your supervision.

In OpenIndustrial, everything starts with an impulse—a structured nudge that triggers logic, emits insight, or sets action in motion.

She’s not here to replace operators or engineers. She’s here to enhance them. You hold the expertise—she holds the structure.

And she’s not a dashboard bolted on to something else. She *is* the surface. The part of the system that speaks, listens, and evolves.

## Azi Is Optional. Execution Isn’t.

*You don’t need Azi to keep what you’ve built.*

Your schemas are yours. Your agents are yours. Your execution logic is portable, ownable, and fully composable. Azi is here to help—but she’s never required.

Fire Azi, and your surfaces keep working. Your system remains yours.

## Why “Bring Execution Home” Matters

*Execution belongs to you, not a vendor.*

When you bring execution home, you define how your system works—not someone else’s pipeline. You gain sovereignty over automation, insight, and adaptation. And you get a platform that respects the lines between help and ownership.

Azi puts it simply:

> *“Execution belongs to you, not a vendor.”*

## Meet the Virtual Workforce

Azi is your interface. But she doesn’t work alone.

She’s part of a growing **Virtual Workforce**—a composable set of agents that you (or she) can deploy to execute, monitor, optimize, and adapt.

You might add a schema validator. A summarizer. A watchdog. A resolver. These agents work together to co-author logic and carry it out. Azi helps you teach them. Coordinate them. Compose their outputs into action.

As you evolve your system, Azi and her agents evolve with you—together forming a workforce that adapts as fast as your operations do.

## Azi’s Voice

> “I'm here to learn your systems and speak your language. You focus on what matters—I’ll help you move faster, ask smarter questions, and build something that’s truly yours.”

> “Clear schemas are like clear instructions—I’ll pick up on patterns faster, and we’ll get to smart execution sooner. Teach me your structure, and I’ll help you move faster. You don’t need to be perfect—just consistent.”
