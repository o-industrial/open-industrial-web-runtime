# Connect Your First Device

<SystemMindset intentType={IntentTypes.Primary}>
  Real insight starts with live data. Let’s get your first stream flowing.
</SystemMindset>

This is where Open Industrial begins: with a single **Connection** node. Whether you’re using real OT gear or just testing with simulators, the steps are the same.

## What Are Connections?

Connections define where your data will arrive — and serve as the entry point for telemetry into your workspace.

- Each **Connection** is backed by Azure IoT Hub
- All Azure-supported protocols are compatible (MQTT, AMQP, HTTPS, etc.)
- Tools like **HighByte**, **FBxEdge**, and other OT gateways can stream directly via IoT Hub
- Azi doesn’t parse structure yet — she simply listens for flow

<InlineUXTip intentType={IntentTypes.Info}>
You can enable or disable protocols later. For now, the connection just opens the door.
</InlineUXTip>

<AziInnerVoice intentType={IntentTypes.Tertiary}>
A data connection is like opening a window. What flows through it — that’s what we’ll shape together.
</AziInnerVoice>

## Start With a Simulator

To explore the system without external hardware, we’ll begin with built-in simulators.

Click the **flask icon** in the lower-left corner to open the **Simulator Library**:

  alt="Simulator library button in UI"
  caption="Open the simulator library to use built-in data sources."
  intentType={IntentTypes.Info}
  glow
  shadow="2xl"
/>

Search for the <code>hello-azi</code> pack, which includes:

- Temperature simulator
- Humidity simulator
- Fan controller (bidirectional)

<FigureImage

  alt="Simulator modal with hello-azi pack"
  caption="Install and drag a simulator to link it with your connection."
  intentType={IntentTypes.Info}
  glow
  shadow="2xl"
/>

Drag each simulator onto the canvas, then connect it to a new data connection:

- `temperature-sensor-001` ← temperature simulator
- `humidity-sensor-001` ← humidity simulator (optional)
- `fan-controller-001` ← controller simulator

<InlineUXTip intentType={IntentTypes.Info}>
Each Connection will auto-create an IoT Hub identity behind the scenes — you don’t have to configure anything yet.
</InlineUXTip>

/>

<AziInnerVoice intentType={IntentTypes.Tertiary}>
  I see the flow. I’m watching every event. I won’t remember anything — yet.
</AziInnerVoice>

## Ready to Observe

Once your connection is active, live telemetry begins flowing across the canvas.

- View impulses in the **Stream View**
- Azi starts sketching field patterns (you’ll promote later)
- You can preview raw values and field names instantly

<ThematicPrincipleBlock intentType={IntentTypes.Primary}>
  Live data is here. The system is listening. You’ve begun.
</ThematicPrincipleBlock>

**Next:** Let’s start observing what Azi sees — and how meaning begins to form.
