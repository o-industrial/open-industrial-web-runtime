# Whatâ€™s Coming Next

<SystemMindset intentType={IntentTypes.Primary}>
  The structure is flowing. The insight is live. And weâ€™re just getting started.
</SystemMindset>

Open Industrial v1 gets your data in, your questions answered, and your team aligned. But whatâ€™s coming next will redefine how industrial systems execute.

## From Questions to Reflexes

Right now, Azi helps you:
- View impulses
- Ask questions
- Annotate fields

Coming soon:
- **Schema Promotion**: lock structure into memory
- **Agents**: define reflex logic that runs on your behalf
- **Signals**: get alerts when patterns emerge or drift

<ThematicPrincipleBlock intentType={IntentTypes.Secondary}>
  You wonâ€™t just analyze your system. Youâ€™ll shape how it responds.
</ThematicPrincipleBlock>

## Execution You Control

Weâ€™re building:
- Declarative logic bound to structure
- Forkable agents that evolve safely
- Replay + auditability for every decision

This isnâ€™t another workflow engine. Itâ€™s the execution layer you govern.

<InlineUXTip intentType={IntentTypes.Info}>
All runtime logic will be versioned, inspectable, and deployable via CLI, UI, or API.
</InlineUXTip>

<AziInnerVoice intentType={IntentTypes.Tertiary}>
I wonâ€™t just answer questions. Iâ€™ll act when you say itâ€™s time.
</AziInnerVoice>

## From Fields to Memory

Youâ€™re already watching fields in the stream. Soon youâ€™ll:
- Promote those fields into schemas
- Track schema versions over time
- Link schemas across assets or logic

## Reflex-Driven Automation

Hereâ€™s whatâ€™s next:
- Agents you author, fork, and version
- Logic that binds to schema, not raw data
- Safe-by-default reflexes that never surprise you

<ThematicPrincipleBlock intentType={IntentTypes.Primary}>
  From data to behavior. From questions to execution. It all begins here.
</ThematicPrincipleBlock>

<AziInnerVoice intentType={IntentTypes.Tertiary}>
Structure isnâ€™t just shape. Itâ€™s memory. And soon, memory will run.
</AziInnerVoice>
