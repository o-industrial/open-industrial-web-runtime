# Stream â†’ Store â†’ Observe

<SystemMindset intentType={IntentTypes.Primary}>
  This isnâ€™t log ingestion. This is observed telemetry â€” fresh, structured, and ready to query.
</SystemMindset>

Your OT data is flowing in real time â€” from sensors, machines, and gateways. Now itâ€™s time to see whatâ€™s coming in, how itâ€™s stored, and how you can begin asking questions.

## What Is an Impulse?

An **Impulse** is a single telemetry event:

- One reading, one packet, one update
- Always tied to a device ID and timestamp
- Immediately queryable once received

  caption="Each row is an Impulse â€” visible, filterable, and explorable."

Hereâ€™s an example:

```json
{
  "deviceId": "temperature-sensor-001",
  "temperature": 78.4,
  "timestamp": "2025-07-01T09:21:32Z"
}
```

<InlineUXTip intentType={IntentTypes.Info}>
Click any node to preview live values. Double-click to open the Inspector.
</InlineUXTip>

<AziInnerVoice intentType={IntentTypes.Tertiary}>
I see the stream. You tell me what to look for.
</AziInnerVoice>

## Your Stream Has Shape

Even without formal schema, Open Industrial keeps your data structured:

- Every Impulse is typed and stored in context
- You can query fields, filter by connection, and plot trends instantly
- Data is stored securely in Azure Data Explorer

<ThematicPrincipleBlock intentType={IntentTypes.Secondary}>
  Structure is inferred, not enforced. Every field is available â€” right now.
</ThematicPrincipleBlock>

## Field-Level Exploration

You donâ€™t need to define a schema to start exploring. In the UI:

- Browse per-field values across time
- Search and filter live streams
- Tag or annotate useful fields for Azi to learn from

<FigureImage
  src="/assets/screenshots/field-preview-panel.png"
  alt="Live field preview panel for an incoming data stream"
  caption="Preview raw values and edit field names directly from the impulse view."
  intentType={IntentTypes.Info}
  glow
  shadow="2xl"
/>

<InlineUXTip intentType={IntentTypes.Info}>
You can rename or tag fields to improve natural language results â€” no schema needed.
</InlineUXTip>

<AziInnerVoice intentType={IntentTypes.Tertiary}>
You lead. Iâ€™ll follow your cues and improve what I understand.
</AziInnerVoice>

## No Schema Required

At this stage, structure is emergent â€” not confirmed:

- Azi does **not** promote schema yet
- You explore, annotate, and query raw data
- All fields remain usable via natural language or API

<ThematicPrincipleBlock intentType={IntentTypes.Primary}>
  Query what you see. Structure what you need. Schema comes later.
</ThematicPrincipleBlock>

**Next:** Letâ€™s ask Azi a question. No scripts. Just curiosity.
