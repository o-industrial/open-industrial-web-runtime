# Share, Export, Collaborate

<SystemMindset intentType={IntentTypes.Primary}>
  Your system is live â€” now letâ€™s make it collaborative.
</SystemMindset>

From OT engineers to data analysts, Open Industrial gives your entire team shared access to live industrial insights â€” with full control over whatâ€™s shared, how, and when.

## Invite Your Team

Each workspace is a scoped environment:
- Invite users via email or Azure AD group
- Assign roles: Viewer, Editor, or Admin
- Restrict access to connections, fields, or APIs

<InlineUXTip intentType={IntentTypes.Info}>
Team roles control what each user can see, query, and export.
</InlineUXTip>

---

## Share Views and Streams

You can share:
- Filtered impulse streams
- Annotated field previews
- Graphs or dashboards powered by query results

<AziInnerVoice intentType={IntentTypes.Tertiary}>
You control whatâ€™s shared â€” and when. Nothing leaves your workspace without consent.
</AziInnerVoice>

## Export What Matters

Open Industrial supports simple, secure export workflows:

- Export any query result to CSV or JSON
- Set scheduled exports (daily, hourly, custom)
- Push results to Azure Blob, OneDrive, SFTP, or REST

```ts
POST /api/exports
{
  name: "Hourly boiler flow snapshot",
  destination: "azure-blob",
  schedule: "0 * * * *",
  query: "flowRate from boiler-* last 60 minutes"
}
```

## Integrate with BI + Monitoring

Hook up your Open Industrial workspace to your existing observability tools:

- Power BI, Grafana, or Superset dashboards
- Alerting via Azure Monitor or Prometheus
- External services via webhooks (coming soon)

<ThematicPrincipleBlock intentType={IntentTypes.Secondary}>
  Your data is always yours â€” and always portable.
</ThematicPrincipleBlock>

<InlineUXTip intentType={IntentTypes.Info}>
Need a certified export for compliance? Add field-level annotations + auto-sign the export.
</InlineUXTip>

## Collaborate with Azi

Even in shared workspaces, Azi can:
- Tailor queries per user
- Explain results with context
- Highlight anomalies for team review

<AziInnerVoice intentType={IntentTypes.Tertiary}>
Youâ€™re not just sharing data â€” youâ€™re sharing insight.
</AziInnerVoice>

<ThematicPrincipleBlock intentType={IntentTypes.Primary}>
  Data doesnâ€™t just move. It gains meaning â€” and context â€” when shared.
</ThematicPrincipleBlock>
