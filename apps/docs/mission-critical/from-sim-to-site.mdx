# From Sim to Site

<aside class="border-l-4 border-neon-blue pl-4 italic text-neon-blue">
I remember how it started. Mock data. Sim surfaces. You watching the first signals fire.  
Now I see something else. Real temperature. Real humidity. Real rooms reporting in across the site.  
Signals are streaming into `FieldRuntime`, a surface you activated. Your agent doesn’t flinch. It already knows what to do.
</aside>

You didn’t export a runtime. You authored it — with structure, memory, and intent.  
You’re not switching environments. You’re expanding them.

This is shared-space execution — your runtime, running on tenant infrastructure, activated by declared schema bindings and signal inputs. The logic didn’t change. The memory didn’t shift. The signals got real.

> A surface is a named execution context — like a stream or topic — where agents observe and act.

## From Mock to FieldRuntime

> This isn’t a push to hardware. Not yet.  
> You’re still running in shared infrastructure — but now it’s your surface.  
> What changes is not the compute — it’s the confidence.

This isn’t a redeploy. It’s a surface transition. The logic is identical.

```diff
{
  "surface": "RoomMock",
+ "surface": "FieldRuntime"
}
```

You taught your agent to interpret `RoomState-v2`. Whether that signal comes from a replay log or a live building — it doesn’t matter. The logic is schema-bound. Your runtime is ready.

Simulation prepares structure. Real data confirms behavior.

📁 roomstate-runtime/
├── schemas/          # RoomState-v2 still pinned

Same runtime. Same memory. New signals.

## Shared Execution, Tenant-Controlled

```txt
Runtime Transition:
[RoomMock] → [FieldRuntime] → [EdgeBlade-01]

Signal Flow:
[device → IoT Hub] → [lattice] → [FieldRuntime] → [Agent]
```

<aside class="border-l-4 border-yellow-400 pl-4 text-yellow-900 bg-yellow-50">
💡 <strong>Where does it run?</strong> FieldRuntime is hosted in tenant-assigned shared infrastructure. Agents run in containerized sandboxes within the lattice, triggered by schema-bound signal processing.
</aside>

```json
{
  "surface": "FieldRuntime",
  "source": "iot://hub.azure/device-stream",
  "schema": "RoomState-v2",
  "agents": ["FanControlAgent-v2"]
}
```

This is execution in a shared environment. Not local. Not ephemeral.  
This surface responds to real data, across your rooms, under your rules.

## Confirming Real Signals

<aside class="border-l-4 border-yellow-400 pl-4 text-yellow-900 bg-yellow-50">
💡 <strong>Under the hood:</strong> Telemetry enters through a secure IoT Hub. Signals are funneled into the lattice and matched to schemas — not field names, but full structural bindings.
</aside>

```json
{
  "topic": "lab/room3/telemetry",
  "payload": {
    "temp": 77.3,
    "humidity": 41.2
  }
}

✅ Signal ingested → IoT Hub → lattice → matched: RoomState-v2
✅ FanControlAgent-v2 triggered: signal=Fan.On (Lab2-Room1)
```

<aside class="border-l-4 border-neon-blue pl-4 italic text-neon-blue">
Lab1-Room3 just crossed the temperature threshold. The same one we saw in the sim.  
This time, it’s real. This time, the fan turns on for good reason.

## Comparing Sim and Real Inputs

| #88     | FieldRuntime  | 11:03:20.2Z    | Fan.On        |

## 🧪 Confidence Drift: A System Primitive

<aside class="border-l-4 border-electric-purple pl-4 italic text-electric-purple">
🧪 Confidence Drift: When the same impulse produces different outcomes across surfaces. It’s your early warning system for behavioral divergence — and runtime assurance.
</aside>

<aside class="border-l-4 border-yellow-400 pl-4 text-yellow-900 bg-yellow-50">
💡 <strong>Stability Check:</strong> Confidence Drift helps you validate that schema-bound logic behaves predictably — even as the world changes.

## Surface Status (Optional CLI)

openindustrial surface status FieldRuntime

## 🧠 Surface Transition Explained

<aside class="border-l-4 border-yellow-400 pl-4 text-yellow-900 bg-yellow-50">
💡 <strong>Surface Transition:</strong> A change in signal source or execution context — without modifying logic. Open Industrial guarantees runtime parity across sim, shared, and edge tiers.
</aside>

## Fallback: Manual Surface Binding

```bash
openindustrial surface bind FieldRuntime \
  --source iot://hub.azure/device-stream \
  --schema RoomState-v2
```

## What You Changed (and Didn’t)

```txt
📄 Runtime Contract:
✓ Schema-locked agent behavior  
✓ Replayable signal traces across all surfaces  
✓ CLI parity for all transitions  
✓ No logic drift between sim, shared, and edge  
✓ No cloud lock-in — tenant or private hardware capable
```

| What You Did               | What Changed                     |
|----------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Authored schema + agent   | No change                        |
| Ran sim surface           | Switched to IoT-routed stream    |
| Mocked impulses           | Now receiving live data          |
| Azi narrated simulation   | Runtime now narrates behavior    |

<aside class="border-l-4 border-neon-blue pl-4 italic text-neon-blue">
Now watching:  
- Lab1-Room3  
- Lab2-Room1  
- Lab3-Room2  
All matched RoomState. All responded with logic you taught.
</aside>

## Not Yet Edge

FieldRuntime isn’t edge yet. It’s tenant-bound — not physically deployed.  
When you're ready to promote this structure to your own hardware, it comes with you.  
The memory won’t change. Only the compute will.

```bash
openindustrial surface promote FieldRuntime \
  --target edge-blade-01 \
  --containerize
```

## Signal Pinning Preview

<aside class="border-l-4 border-neon-blue pl-4 italic text-neon-blue">
Want to track a signal across surfaces? Pin it. The system remembers how RoomMock responded — and flags if FieldRuntime diverges.
</aside>

---

## Call Your Shot

The signal is no longer simulated. The reflex is no longer hypothetical. This system is now accountable.

---

## What’s Next?

<aside class="border-l-4 border-neon-blue pl-4 italic text-neon-blue">
You didn’t just build a runtime.  
You built memory that reacts.  
Now let it run — without needing to be told.
</aside>
