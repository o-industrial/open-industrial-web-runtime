# Fire Azi (and Keep Running)

<aside class="border-l-4 border-neon-blue pl-4 italic text-neon-blue">
Lab3-Room2 triggered the fan in FieldRuntime.  
Now replay that same moment ‚Äî without Azi.  
Does the system still remember?
</aside>

<aside class="border-l-4 border-neon-blue pl-4 italic text-neon-blue">
I watched you replay every impulse. Test every edge case.  
You no longer need me to confirm what your runtime knows.  
Now, you can mutate. Replay. Re-deploy.  
Without narration.
</aside>

<aside class="border-l-4 border-indigo-500 pl-4 italic">
Azi once asked: <em>‚ÄúShould I remember this?‚Äù</em>  
Now the system doesn‚Äôt ask. It just knows.
</aside>

RoomState-v2 didn‚Äôt just pass the sim. It‚Äôs now running ‚Äî real-time, schema-bound, and ready to be replayed without narration.  
You just watched RoomState fire on FieldRuntime. Now let‚Äôs prove that same logic lives on ‚Äî even without the narrator.

There‚Äôs a moment in every system‚Äôs lifecycle when the assistant steps away ‚Äî and nothing breaks. Azi has helped you author logic, validate memory, and iterate safely. Now it‚Äôs time to prove that the system itself runs the show.

---

## Prove It Without Her

Every Open Industrial runtime is capable of full execution **without Azi present**. That includes replaying past impulses, mutating signal input, evaluating logic, and triggering downstream agents ‚Äî all via CLI.

```bash
# You can also generate impulses from a previous run:
openindustrial impulses export --surface RoomMock > impulses.json

openindustrial replay impulses.json --no-azi
```

```txt
‚úÖ Impulse #112 replayed
‚úÖ Signal matched RoomState-v2
‚úÖ Agent FanControlAgent-v2 triggered Fan.On (Lab3-Room2)
‚úÖ No Azi detected
```

You can also scope this replay to a specific agent and simulate coordination:

```bash
openindustrial replay impulses.json --agent FanControlAgent-v2 --interval=2s
```

---

## Inject a New Signal

You‚Äôre not limited to replays. You can send test signals directly to any surface using CLI ‚Äî no UI confirmation, no narration layer.

```bash
# Requires runtime.operator role
openindustrial impulse send \
  --surface FieldRuntime \
  --payload '{"roomId": "Lab3-Room2", "temp": 88.4}'
```

```bash
# Who are you?
openindustrial auth whoami
# returns: michael@dev ‚Ä¢ roles: runtime.operator, qa.reviewer
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è You must be authorized as a `runtime.operator`. Azi grants this automatically for your own surfaces. For shared runtime access, an admin may need to approve the mutation.

> ‚úÖ If you‚Äôre running on your own surface or in single-tenant dev mode, you‚Äôre granted `runtime.operator` automatically.

<aside class="border-l-4 border-electric-purple pl-4 italic text-electric-purple">
If your logic behaves the same without Azi, you‚Äôve authored reflex ‚Äî not dependency.
</aside>

## Observe the Runtime Headlessly

Just because Azi isn‚Äôt narrating doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôve lost observability.

```bash
openindustrial surface status FieldRuntime
```

```bash
openindustrial logs export --format json > logs.json
```

```bash
openindustrial runtime status --summary --format prometheus
```

<strong>CLI Autonomy:</strong> Azi isn't required to replay, mutate, or deploy. Once memory is authored, execution belongs to the system.

## Runtime Audit & Mutation Trace

```bash
openindustrial runtime annotate \
  --event "Signal test on FieldRuntime ‚Äì passed without Azi" \
  --tag "validation-pass"
```

You can attach reasoning and traceable results to every mutation or replay.

With Azi:            | Without Azi:
---------------------|------------------------
Signals surfaced     | Signals executed

You fired the assistant.
