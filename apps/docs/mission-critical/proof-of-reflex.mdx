# Proof of Reflex

<small class="text-sm text-neutral-400 tracking-wide uppercase">Your system. Your logic. Validated and executable without narration.</small>

<aside class="border-l-4 border-neon-blue pl-4 italic text-neon-blue">
You’ve fired the assistant. Now let’s see if the system holds up under audit.
</aside>

This isn’t Azi’s checklist. It’s yours.

This page confirms your system is fully operational and promotable — not just by Azi’s narration, but via visible, auditable commands. Azi walks you through the validations. But every signal, every schema, every approval has a CLI counterpart.

<aside class="border-l-4 border-yellow-400 bg-yellow-50 pl-4 text-yellow-900">
<strong>What is a Runtime?</strong><br />
A runtime is a validated memory snapshot — schema, surface, agent, and impulse — ready for deployment. It can run as a container in shared tenancy, or export to edge as a CLI-only package.
</aside>

## Runtime Observability

Azi displays agent readiness indicators, including live health and signal lag. Users can click to export log views.

```bash
openindustrial logs export --format json
openindustrial runtime status --summary
```

> Output includes agent state, last signal, signal lag, and error counts.

```bash
openindustrial logs export --format prometheus | curl -X POST http://prometheus.example.com/api/metrics
```

> Metrics can be forwarded to any Prometheus-compatible collector.

## CI Validation

<aside class="border-l-4 border-cyan-500 bg-cyan-50 text-cyan-900 p-4 my-6">
<strong>Impulse Source:</strong><br />
Use the CLI to generate replayable test data:

```bash
openindustrial impulses export --surface FieldRuntime > impulses.json
```

<small>This exports the latest observed signals from your chosen surface for downstream CI validation.</small>
</aside>

Azi highlights results from replay validation:

<aside class="border-l-4 border-neon-blue pl-4 italic text-neon-blue">
4/5 passed. Impulse #88 failed — unexpected Fan.Off.
</aside>

To run this manually:

```bash
openindustrial validate runtime --impulses ./tests/fan.json \
  --expect signal=Fan.On \
  --log-to ci-results.json
```

```bash
❌ Validation failed: Impulse #92 triggered Fan.Off
CI failed with exit code 1. Promotion halted.
```

> Exit code `1` signals failure. CI trace is stored.

<div class="border-l-4 border-cyan-500 bg-cyan-50 text-cyan-900 p-4 my-6">
<strong>Expect Conditions:</strong><br />
Use `--expect` to define runtime expectations:
<ul class="list-disc pl-6">
  <li><code>signal=Fan.On</code> – signal must match this value</li>
  <li><code>signal!=Fan.Off</code> – signal must not equal this value</li>
  <li><code>matches=RoomState-v2</code> – output must match this schema</li>
  <li><code>latency&lt;100ms</code> – response must occur within threshold</li>
</ul>
</div>

## Confidence Drift

Azi visualizes divergence between `RoomMock` and `FieldRuntime` surfaces. Impulse reactions are displayed side-by-side.

```bash
openindustrial replay impulses.json \
  --surface RoomMock \
  --compare FieldRuntime
```

> CLI comparison outputs a table of signal responses per surface.

<aside class="border-l-4 border-electric-purple pl-4 italic text-electric-purple">
The same impulse. Two surfaces. One difference. That’s where your system learns.
</aside>

---

## RBAC and Promotion Approval

Azi enforces role boundaries:

<aside class="border-l-4 border-neon-blue pl-4 italic text-neon-blue">
You don’t have approval rights. Would you like me to notify a reviewer?
</aside>

CLI equivalents:

```bash
openindustrial schema promote RoomState-v2 --requires-approval
# ❌ Unauthorized
openindustrial schema approve RoomState-v2 --by reviewer@company.com
```

```bash
openindustrial alerts configure \
  --signal=Fan.On \
  --notify=slack://ops-channel
```

> Notifications can be triggered on validated signal events.

<aside class="border-l-4 border-yellow-400 bg-yellow-50 pl-4 text-yellow-900">
<strong>Approval Policy Snapshot:</strong>

```json
"approval": {
  "required": true,
  "roles": ["qa.reviewer"],
  "approvals": ["reviewer@company.com"]
}
```
</aside>

---

## Manual Rollback

Azi prompts you to select a trusted impulse:

<aside class="border-l-4 border-neon-blue pl-4 italic text-neon-blue">
We’ve seen this impulse before. The system behaved.  
Want to go back to that moment? I’ll roll you there.
</aside>

```bash
openindustrial runtime diff --compare current vs backup:impulse-88
# Output: schema and agent match. Surface bindings diverge.

openindustrial runtime rollback --to impulse:88 --confirm
```

> Restores runtime to a known good state after confirmation.

<aside class="border-l-4 border-yellow-400 bg-yellow-50 pl-4 text-yellow-900">
<strong>Mutation Rules:</strong>
<ul class="list-disc pl-6">
  <li>Replays never alter runtime state</li>
  <li>CI validation is read-only</li>
  <li>Rollbacks revert surface, agent, and schema — not memory history</li>
  <li>All mutations are logged in the export manifest</li>
</ul>
</aside>

---

## Final Audit and Export

Azi confirms the system passed validation and offers to export the runtime manifest:

<aside class="border-l-4 border-neon-blue pl-4 italic text-neon-blue">
Runtime validated. Signals clean. Approval granted.  
Would you like me to prepare the runtime export?
</aside>

```bash
openindustrial runtime annotate --tag "qa-ok" --comment "Ready for deploy"
openindustrial runtime export --handoff \
  --out ./exports/deploy-ready-runtime.json \
  --format json \
  --sign --tag reflex-pass
```

The final export should contain metadata like:

```json
"handoff": {
  "validatedBy": "qa@company.com",
  "approved": true,
  "lastImpulse": 112,
  "ciTrace": "./ci-results.json",
  "signature": "6e9b0a1f4c61f8d8aa...",
  "tag": "reflex-pass"
}
```

<aside class="border-l-4 border-yellow-400 bg-yellow-50 pl-4 text-yellow-900">
Reflex is more than logic. It’s replayable, auditable, and promotable — with or without a guide.
</aside>

📦 Runtime Context:  
- Schema: RoomState-v2  
- Surface: FieldRuntime  
- Agents: FanControlAgent-v2  
- Memory: ./impulses/  
- Status: ✅ Validated  
- Exported As: deploy-ready-runtime.json
```

## Runtime Contract (Post-Validation)

```txt
📜 Runtime Contract:
✓ Schema logic passed validation
✓ Agent responses consistent across surfaces
✓ Promotion approved via RBAC
✓ CI logs persisted
✓ Runtime exported, fingerprinted, and ready for deploy
```

<aside class="border-l-4 border-yellow-400 bg-yellow-50 pl-4 text-yellow-900">
This runtime no longer needs explanation.  
It runs, rolls back, and reveals its own integrity.  
Sign the export. Launch the system.
</aside>

- ✅ All schema logic validated
- ✅ Confidence Drift reviewed
- ✅ Promotion approved
- ✅ CI logs captured
- ✅ Runtime status: ✅ ready

<aside class="border-l-4 border-neon-blue pl-4 italic text-neon-blue">
