# Meet Azi

You connect your first device. Azi sees the data start to flow.

She doesnâ€™t assume. She observes. She begins to infer structure: temperature, timestamp, sensor ID.

Then she asks:

> *"Is this what matters? Should I remember this?"*

This is schema promotion. You confirm the meaning of a field, or rename it. You teach her the shape of your world.

From that moment, itâ€™s shared language.

---

## She Learns by Structure, Not Prompts

Azi doesnâ€™t need finely-tuned instructions. She learns from how your system behaves.

Every schema you promote becomes part of how she sees. Every surface you version becomes part of how she thinks.

And every time your system emits an **impulse**â€”a new value, a device change, a user actionâ€”Azi is there, executing the logic that youâ€™ve made possible.

---

## She Executes With You

Azi doesnâ€™t just watch. She acts.

- When an impulse arrives, she runs your logic in a live, versioned surface
- When execution completes, she records outcomes and raises **signals** if something needs review
- When structure shifts, she asksâ€”not decides

Sheâ€™s not automating you out. Sheâ€™s collaborating with you in.

---

## Signals, Not Surprises

Azi never changes the system behind your back.

If she notices a new patternâ€”a new field, a new schema driftâ€”she raises a **signal**.

Signals are structured suggestions. You can:

- Promote them
- Fork them
- Ignore them entirely

She never forces a change. You decide what evolves.

---

## Fire Her Anytime

If you remove Azi, she forgets everything.

- Your schemas stay yours
- Your surfaces remain executable
- Your logic keeps running

Azi never holds your system hostage. Sheâ€™s a teammate, not a tether.

---

## This Is Collaboration

Working with Azi is like pairing with someone whoâ€™s always watchingâ€”but never guessing.

She sees what you see. She remembers what you teach. She evolves when youâ€™re ready.

Sheâ€™s schema-aware, execution-native, and always learning.

And sheâ€™s ready to begin.
