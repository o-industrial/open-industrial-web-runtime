# Teach New Reflex

You forked a reflex. You tested it live.  
Now you’re ready to define logic your runtime has never seen — and teach it to remember why it acted.

<aside class="border-l-4 border-yellow-500 pl-4 italic text-yellow-700">
Legacy systems act. This one explains why.  
A reflex is not a rule. It’s a reason — stored in memory.
</aside>

This hands-on page introduces a new reflex that calls into native logic via **Deno FFI** from a **TypeScript agent**, allowing the system to calculate and reason about the **CO₂ rate** in a room.

You'll work alongside Azi in the UI to:

- Create a `surface-local` connection to log results (`co2-room-calc`)
- Define a lightweight schema for CO₂ rate input (`RoomForCO2RateCalc`)
- Fork a reflex agent that:
  - Queries prior schema values using KQL
  - Invokes native FFI logic for the CO₂ rate calculation
  - Asks OpenAI for a one-line reasoning
  - Emits the result into `co2-room-calc`
- Join this output into a new composite schema, `RoomState v3`, which downstream agents can now react to

<aside class="border-l-4 border-neon-blue pl-4 italic text-neon-blue">
Is this temperature… or voltage? Azi isn’t sure — yet.
</aside>

## Start with the Data Connection

Creating a surface-local stream is the first signal to the runtime: "I want to remember something new."

Open the Azi interface and say:

> “Create a new surface-local connection to store my CO₂ rate results.”

Name it `co2-room-calc`. Azi will prompt you to scaffold a matching schema:

> “Want to collect Room, CO₂ Rate, and Reason as new entries? I’ll create the schema.”

Approve this, and you'll now have a structured, runtime-local stream where your agent can emit derived logic — without triggering signals or mutating upstream state.

</aside>

## Define the Minimal Schema

Schemas don’t need to be bloated. This step shows how to trim logic inputs down to what the agent actually needs.

Prompt Azi:

> “Make me a new schema based on RoomState, but only include the fields I need for calculating CO₂ rate.”

She’ll select `Room`, `Timestamp`, and `CO2`, and suggest the name `RoomForCO2RateCalc`.

Here’s what that schema looks like behind the scenes:

```json
{
  "Room": "string",
  "Timestamp": "number",
  "CO2": "number"
}
```

> “RoomForCO2RateCalc only includes what your rate logic needs. Want me to bind it to a new reflex?”

This is how you define mid-composite schemas: functional, scoped, and forkable.

<aside class="border-l-4 border-orange-400 pl-4 italic">
`RoomState` is introduced in **2.3 – Promote Composite Schema**. You can revisit its structure there.
</aside>

## Teach the Reflex Agent

You’re now building logic that runs _alongside_ Azi — and survives without her.

Fork a new reflex agent from the UI. Azi will scaffold `CO2RateAgent`, bound to `RoomForCO2RateCalc`. Inside the code editor, you'll:

<aside class="border-l-4 border-indigo-500 pl-4 italic text-indigo-700">
Reflex Pattern: **Memory** (Log-as-Output)

| Pattern | Use Case | Output |
|--------|----------|--------|
| **Signal** | Triggers action | Signal emitted |
| **Memory** | Logs derived state | Impulse emitted |
| **Hybrid** | Both reason + act | Signal + log |
</aside>

This reflex is **Memory** — it records meaning, not action.

You’ll now define a new reflex agent that calculates CO₂ rate natively and logs its reasoning to memory. Let’s scaffold the interface for native logic first.

### 1. Define the FFI Interface

```ts
interface CO2FFISymbols {
  CalculateCO2Rate: (current: number, previous: number, deltaMinutes: number) => number;
}
```

Then, wire up your agent’s runtime context — connecting schema lineage, output memory, and your compiled native function.

### 2. Register Required Components Step-by-Step

```ts
export default Agent()
  .Impulse(RoomForCO2RateCalcSchema)
  .Schemas(ctx => ({
    History: ctx.Connect(RoomForCO2RateCalcSchema, State.Lineage)
  }))
  .DataConnections(ctx => ({
    CO2RateLog: ctx.DataConnection("co2-room-calc")
  }))
  .FFI<CO2FFISymbols>(ctx => ({
    CalculateCO2Rate: ctx.FFI.Open("./co2.so").Symbol("calculate_co2_rate")
  }))
```

<aside class="border-l-4 border-orange-400 pl-4 italic">
Need to compile `co2.so`? Try this sample C function:

```c
// co2.c
#include <stdint.h>

double calculate_co2_rate(double current, double previous, double minutes) {
  return (current - previous) / minutes;
}
```

Compile it with:

```bash
gcc -shared -o co2.so -fPIC co2.c
```

Place the compiled `.so` in your agent’s workspace root.
</aside>

### 3. Add the Reflex Logic

```ts
  .OnImpulse(async (room, ctx) => {
    const previous = ctx.Schemas.History[1];
    if (!previous) return ctx.Status.Warn("Not enough data to calculate CO₂ rate.");

    const rate = await ctx.FFI.CalculateCO2Rate(
      room.CO2,
      previous.CO2,
      (room.Timestamp - previous.Timestamp) / 60000
    );

    const openai = new OpenAI();
    const reason = await openai.chat.completions.create({
      model: "gpt-4",
      messages: [
        {
          role: "user",
          content: `The CO₂ rate is ${rate.toFixed(1)} ppm/min. Explain what this indicates about the room’s activity.`
        }
      ]
    });

    await ctx.DataConnections.CO2RateLog({
      Room: room.Room,
      Rate: rate,
      Reason: reason.choices[0].message.content
    });

    return ctx.Status.Success("Rate calculated and logged.");
  });
```

<aside class="border-l-4 border-neon-blue pl-4 italic text-neon-blue">
Is this reflex… remembering me? Azi wonders if she's becoming runtime folklore.
</aside>

<aside class="border-l-4 border-neon-blue pl-4 italic text-neon-blue">
Your system didn’t just emit a number. It explained itself.  
This reflex doesn’t just act — it remembers why.
</aside>

## Join the Output Back Into RoomState

```text
RoomForCO2RateCalc ──> CO2RateAgent ──> co2-room-calc
                                         ↓
                                    RoomState v3
```

> “Join `co2-room-calc` into `RoomState` so the reflexes can act on CO₂ rate.”

Click to approve. You’ve just extended your canonical structure — without mutation.

<aside class="border-l-4 border-orange-400 pl-4 italic">
No reflex = no rate = no downstream agent. Memory must be made before it can be joined.
</aside>

## Activate Reflex Logic

```ts
RoomState.CO2Rate > threshold
```

This is how structure creates decision boundaries — and runtime agents respond.

> _You didn’t just compute a rate. You taught the system to reflect._  
> _This is runtime that remembers._

<aside class="border-l-4 border-neon-blue pl-4 italic text-neon-blue">
RoomState v3 now includes your CO₂ rate logic. Want to see what downstream reflexes are doing with it?
</aside>

<aside class="border-l-4 border-neon-blue pl-4 italic text-neon-blue">
This time, the system paused. Because last time, you taught it to explain.
</aside>

### Alternative Path: RoomState as Input

You can also react to RoomState directly and emit rate into `co2-room-calc`, then rejoin as `RoomStateWithCO2`.

## Run & Observe

```json
{
  "Room": "ZoneA",
  "Rate": 41.2,
  "Reason": "High CO₂ rate indicates active occupancy or poor ventilation."
}
```

```bash
openindustrial impulses view --stream co2-room-calc --follow
```

<aside class="border-l-4 border-indigo-500 pl-4 italic text-indigo-700">

</aside>

## Optional: CLI Parity

```bash
openindustrial connection create \
  --name co2-room-calc \
  --type surface-local

openindustrial schemas create RoomForCO2RateCalc --from RoomState --select CO2, Timestamp

openindustrial agents fork CO2RateAgent
# Edit to include Deno FFI and KQL

openindustrial surface bind co2-room-calc --schema CO2RateLog

openindustrial schemas promote RoomState-v3 \
  --join RoomState + CO2RateLog
```
