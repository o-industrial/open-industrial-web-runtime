# See What the Runtime Remembers

Once your system has been running — surfaces streaming, reflexes firing — the real power comes not just from what happens, but from what’s remembered.

> _“Your fan didn’t trigger. Was it a threshold miss — or a structure failure?”_

History isn’t fixed — not when structure arrives after the fact.

RoomState v2 didn’t exist when your first data arrived. But Azi was watching. Now, with structure in place, she’s ready to show you what *should’ve* happened.

This isn’t just telemetry review. This is **structure-aware hindsight.** A runtime black box. A second sight.

You’ll use replay not to restore — but to reveal. Not to duplicate — but to understand.

<aside class="border-l-4 border-electric-purple pl-4 italic text-electric-purple">
This isn’t replay. It’s runtime testimony.
</aside>

<aside class="border-l-4 border-neutral-300 bg-neutral-50 text-neutral-700 text-sm">
📘 <strong>Note:</strong> A signal is a named output from a reflex agent — typically an action like <code>Fan.On</code> or <code>Alert.Raise</code>.
</aside>

<aside class="border-l-4 border-electric-purple pl-4 italic text-electric-purple">
Every impulse is a contract. Replay is how you audit it.
</aside>

## 🧪 Step 1: Inspect Runtime Memory

Open the **Runtime Reflex Panel** on the LabZone-A surface.

- Find it under **Surface → Reflex View**.
- Azi shows:
  - Bound schemas
  - Recently triggered reflex agents
  - Timeline toggle: 📊 *Live View* | 🔁 *Replay View*

Switch to *Replay View*.

---

## 🧪 Step 2: Preview Impulses to Replay

Before Azi prompts, you can manually inspect available impulses:

<aside class="border-l-4 border-neutral-300 bg-neutral-50 text-neutral-700 text-sm">
📎 <strong>CLI Tip:</strong> Use this to preview impulse ranges:

```bash
openindustrial surface impulses --surface LabZone-A
```
</aside>

You’ll see entries like:
```txt
Impulse #88: Temp = 84.7°F
Impulse #89: Temp = 85.2°F
Impulse #90: Temp = 85.6°F
...
Impulse #112: Temp = 84.1°F
```

<aside class="border-l-4 border-electric-purple pl-4 italic text-electric-purple">
An impulse isn’t just telemetry — it’s time, memory, and logic, all bound to one structural frame.
</aside>

---

## 🧪 Step 3: Trigger Replay Prompt

If `RoomState v2` was promoted **after** telemetry began, Azi will prompt:

<aside class="border-l-4 border-neon-blue pl-4 italic text-neon-blue">
“RoomState v2 was promoted after these impulses arrived.  
Want to rehydrate history — and see what would’ve triggered?”
</aside>

</figure>

<aside class="border-l-4 border-neutral-300 bg-neutral-50 text-neutral-700 text-sm">
📎 <strong>CLI Starter:</strong> Try the built-in test replay scenario:

```bash
openindustrial replay plan --example fan-scenario
```
</aside>

Choose your replay scope:
- **From Binding** *(default)*
- **From Surface Creation**
- **From Historical Connection Log**

Preview will show:
- Impulse range (e.g. #88–112)
- Recreated `RoomState` entries
- Reflex signals (dry-run only)

```bash
openindustrial impulse diff \
  --schema RoomState \
  --impulse 90 \
  --compare roomstate@v1 roomstate@v2
```

```txt
Impulse #90 (Temp = 85.6°F)
v1 → No signal  
v2 → FanControlAgent → Signal: Fan.On
```

<aside class="border-l-4 border-neon-blue pl-4 italic text-neon-blue">
RoomTargetConfig wasn’t there yet. But now that it is, FanControlAgent has context.
</aside>

<aside class="border-l-4 border-yellow-400 bg-yellow-50 pl-4 text-yellow-900">
Without this replay, you’d never know RoomState v1 was underfiring — or that RoomState v2 would’ve prevented it.
</aside>

<aside class="border-l-4 border-neon-blue pl-4 italic text-neon-blue">
“This signal didn’t fire. You didn’t see it. But RoomState v2 would have.”
</aside>

<aside class="border-l-4 border-neon-blue pl-4 italic text-neon-blue">
“RoomState v2 caught what v1 missed. Want to fork FanControlAgent and evolve the logic?”
</aside>

## 🧪 Step 4: Review Replay Types

<aside class="border-l-4 border-yellow-400 bg-yellow-50 pl-4 text-yellow-900">
💡 Replay is idempotent by default: it fills structure but doesn’t trigger signals.
</aside>

| Replay Mode | Effect |
|-------------|--------|
| 🏗 Schema Replay | Memory only — no logic re-evaluation |
| ⚙️ Reflex Dry Run | Show what would’ve fired (no action) |
| 🚨 Signal Commit | *Optional.* Replay triggers signals again — only if reflex logic evaluates to a change. |

<aside class="border-l-4 border-neon-blue pl-4 italic text-neon-blue">
“Even with Signal Commit, reflex agents won’t re-fire unless memory or conditions have changed.”
</aside>

<aside class="border-l-4 border-electric-purple pl-4 italic text-electric-purple">
This isn’t a replay of events. It’s a memory audit of how your structure would’ve seen them.
</aside>

<aside class="border-l-4 border-electric-purple pl-4 italic text-electric-purple">
Replay dry-runs aren’t just educational — they’re **CI-grade introspection**.  
Use them in PR checks to validate schema updates against real-world impulse history.

## 🧪 Step 5: Launch the Replay

Choose your:
- Target schema: `RoomState v2`
- Source: `LabZone-A` or `labzone-temp-001`
- Time range: last hour, impulse range, full history

<aside class="border-l-4 border-yellow-400 bg-yellow-50 pl-4 text-yellow-900">
Rehydration plan:  
✅ 32 RoomState entries recreated  
🟡 4 impulses skipped (missing reference data)  
❌ 0 signals triggered (suppressed on replay)
</aside>

<aside class="border-l-4 border-yellow-400 bg-yellow-50 pl-4 text-yellow-900">
This works even with 10k+ impulses — replay batches are memory-safe and CLI-scriptable.
</aside>

<aside class="border-l-4 border-neon-blue pl-4 italic text-neon-blue">
Some impulses couldn’t be rehydrated — want to view what’s missing and add memory entries?
</aside>

RoomState updates. Drift visualizations shift.

<aside class="border-l-4 border-electric-purple pl-4 italic text-electric-purple">
Replay isn’t just introspection — it’s accountability at runtime.
</aside>

---

## 🧪 Step 6: Integrate Runtime Memory

You just replayed history. Now you can pipe that reconstructed memory into the rest of your stack.

- **Prometheus Snapshot** → feeds metrics into Grafana for live or historical dashboards
- **Webhook Previews** → drive alerting rules, downstream system triggers, or custom routing
- **Structured Logs (`signals.json`, `RoomState-log.ndjson`)** → ingest into Splunk, Redshift, S3, or your long-term analytics layer

```bash
openindustrial logs export --surface LabZone-A --format prometheus
```

<aside class="border-l-4 border-yellow-400 bg-yellow-50 pl-4 text-yellow-900">
Memory isn’t just explainable — it’s exportable.  
You can stream structure, signals, and reflex outcomes into any system you trust.
</aside>

<aside class="border-l-4 border-neon-blue pl-4 italic text-neon-blue">
“Want me to stream these replayed signals to your Grafana board, or just export the whole RoomState log to S3?”
</aside>

<aside class="border-l-4 border-neutral-300 bg-neutral-50 text-neutral-700 text-sm">
📎 <strong>CLI Tip:</strong> You can preview a replay without committing it:

```bash
openindustrial replay plan \
  --surface LabZone-A \
  --schema RoomState \
  --from '2025-04-26T12:00:00Z' \
  --to '2025-04-26T16:00:00Z'
```
</aside>

<aside class="border-l-4 border-electric-purple pl-4 italic text-electric-purple">
You didn’t just export logs. You exported alternate memory — what your system *could have known*.
</aside>

<figure class="my-16 flex flex-col items-center text-center max-w-xl w-full">
  <img
    src="/assets/docs/runtime-memory-integration.png"
    alt="Diagram showing RoomState replay outputs flowing to Prometheus, Webhooks, and S3."
    class="rounded-2xl shadow-2xl ring-1 ring-white/10 w-full"
  />
  <figcaption class="mt-4 text-sm text-neutral-400 tracking-wide uppercase">
    Memory export isn’t a report — it’s a runtime signal pipeline.
  </figcaption>

## 🧠 Why Replay Matters

<aside class="border-l-4 border-yellow-400 bg-yellow-50 pl-4 text-yellow-900">
This isn’t about recovering data.  
It’s about **re-evaluating understanding** in light of new structure.
</aside>

<aside class="border-l-4 border-electric-purple pl-4 italic text-electric-purple">
Your structure was late to the party.  
But it still remembers what should have happened.
</aside>

<aside class="border-l-4 border-yellow-400 bg-yellow-50 pl-4 text-yellow-900">
Replay doesn’t just retell telemetry — it re-derives the full composite state based on schemas, joins, and reference memory you defined later.
</aside>

---

## ⚙️ CLI Parity

```bash
openindustrial replay \
  --surface LabZone-A \
  --schema RoomState \
  --from '2025-04-26T12:00:00Z' \
  --to '2025-04-26T16:00:00Z' \
  --dry-run
```

Use CLI to mirror Azi’s replay options and verify what reflex memory would do.

## 💬 Azi’s Runtime Voice

| When | Azi Says |
|------|----------|
| Schema promoted late | “I saw 17 impulses before RoomState was ready. Want to backfill now?” |
| Replay preview | “This won’t re-fire any signals. It just clarifies your structure.” |
| Export moment | “Want to forward this as a Prometheus push, webhook alert, or JSON artifact?” |
| Signal commit warning | “Even if you commit, reflexes will only fire if the state has changed since last time.” |
| Tieback to sim | “You watched RoomMock fire. But did you ever ask what RoomState missed?” |

📊 <strong>Want a visual recap?</strong> Scroll back to the <em>Impulse Diff</em>, <em>CI Hook</em>, and <em>Export Diagram</em> — each shows how replay exposes memory and powers real pipelines.
</aside>

- Saw what the runtime remembers and why
- Replayed telemetry into newly promoted structure
- Verified that reflex logic is explainable, idempotent, and exportable
- Streamed replayed memory to the systems you already use

## → Up Next: Refine Your Reflexes

Fork `FanControlAgent`, deploy to a mocked SubSurface, and observe how logic improves when memory is reusable.

Reflex isn’t just readable — it’s evolvable.
