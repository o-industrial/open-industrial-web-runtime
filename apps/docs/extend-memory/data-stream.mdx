# Connect the Data Stream

Now your memory’s on the line.  
Data’s arriving — and your structure decides what happens.

Structure doesn’t activate from raw telemetry. It comes alive when protocol meets declaration — and you bind them together.

This page walks you through creating one data connection per device, assigning real or simulated sources, and explicitly binding those to schemas in your workspace. Once bound, reflex agents begin responding — no rewiring, no guessing.

## Create Device Connections

Start from the **Connections** tab. Create one `data-hub` connection per device:

| Device | Connection Name | Supported Protocols |
|--------|------------------|---------------------|
| Temp Sensor | `labzone-temp-001` | MQTT |
| Humidity Sensor | `labzone-hum-001` | MQTT |
| Fan Controller | `labzone-fan-001` | MQTT, REST |
| Air Quality Sensor | `labzone-air-001` | OPC-UA |

<aside class="border-l-4 border-yellow-400 bg-yellow-50 pl-4 text-yellow-900">
💡 One connection per device is the default. Multi-device connections require custom schema mapping.
</aside>

<aside class="border-l-4 border-cyan-500 bg-cyan-50 text-cyan-900 p-4 my-6">
💡 Open Industrial supports all major industrial protocols — MQTT and OPC-UA are shown here as examples. Modbus, BACnet, REST, and more can be used with the same binding model.
</aside>

<aside class="border-l-4 border-gray-300 bg-gray-50 pl-4 text-gray-700 text-sm">
📎 <strong>CLI Tip:</strong> Connections can also be created via terminal:

```bash
openindustrial connection create \
  --name labzone-temp-001 \
  --type data-hub \
  --protocol mqtt
```
</aside>

## Assign Simulators

Each LabZone device has a corresponding simulator bundled in the `labzone-environment-pack`. These simulators run locally, reflect actual telemetry cadences, and transmit over your selected protocol.

```bash
npx openindustrial simulate \
  --workspace labzone-a \
  --device temp-sense-001 \
  --protocol mqtt
```

Repeat for:
- `hum-sense-001` (humidity)
- `fan-control-001` (actuator)
- `air-sense-001` (CO₂/air quality — runs over OPC-UA)

<aside class="border-l-4 border-cyan-500 bg-cyan-50 text-cyan-900 p-4 my-6">
💡 Running real hardware? Just point your edge device to the same protocol endpoint.  
Sim or silicon — the binding works the same.
</aside>

<aside class="border-l-4 border-yellow-400 bg-yellow-50 pl-4 text-yellow-900">
💡 This simulator uses OPC-UA — unlike the others, which speak MQTT. Your runtime needs to support multiple protocols in parallel — including but not limited to MQTT, OPC-UA, Modbus, BACnet, and REST.
</aside>

<aside class="border-l-4 border-neon-blue pl-4 italic text-neon-blue">
Each simulator is a stand-in for a real signal. When it triggers, you’ll see your structure answer back.
</aside>

<aside class="border-l-4 border-neon-blue pl-4 italic text-neon-blue">
Every simulation hits your real data hub — over the protocol you selected. This isn’t mock telemetry. This is structure meeting live flow.
</aside>

<aside class="border-l-4 border-gray-300 bg-gray-50 pl-4 text-gray-700 text-sm">
📎 <strong>CLI Tip:</strong> Once running, each simulator logs messages to your terminal. You’ll also see telemetry arriving in your surface dashboard.

## Bind Schema to Each Stream

As data flows in, Azi opens the **Binding Preview Panel** — a UI modal that displays matching schemas for each connection. Incoming messages are matched against promoted schemas from `RoomState`:

| Device | Suggested Schema |
|--------|------------------|
| `temp-sense-001` | `TemperatureSensor` |
| `hum-sense-001` | `HumiditySensor` |
| `air-sense-001` | `AirQualitySensor` |
| `fan-control-001` | `FanController` |

These bindings only work because you promoted structure in the last step. Azi’s suggestions come from what you authored — not from a guess.

<aside class="border-l-4 border-yellow-400 bg-yellow-50 pl-4 text-yellow-900">
`temp-sense-001` just matched `TemperatureSensor`.  
Reflex memory is listening. FanControlAgent is armed.
</aside>

<aside class="border-l-4 border-gray-300 bg-gray-50 pl-4 text-gray-700 text-sm">
📎 <strong>CLI Tip:</strong> You can also bind schemas via CLI:

```bash
openindustrial surface bind LabZone-A \
  --connection labzone-temp-001 \
  --schema TemperatureSensor
```
</aside>

Repeat for all four devices.

## Fill In the Missing Memory

<aside class="border-l-4 border-yellow-400 bg-yellow-50 pl-4 text-yellow-900">
💡 Reflex logic is only as smart as the reference memory it maps to.
</aside>

Now that data is flowing, Azi checks whether your `DeviceRegistry` and `RoomTargetConfig` schemas have complete entries for each active device.

<aside class="border-l-4 border-neon-blue pl-4 italic text-neon-blue">
“Temp Sensor `temp-sense-001` is active — but not mapped to a room. Want to assign it to Lab1?”
</aside>

You confirm. Azi backfills the entry:

```json
{
  "DeviceID": "temp-sense-001",
  "Room": "Lab1"
}
```

Then she prompts again:

<aside class="border-l-4 border-neon-blue pl-4 italic text-neon-blue">
Lab1 has no target config yet. Based on the live average of 84.1°F, shall we propose 72°F as your threshold?
</aside>

You disagree. You override Azi’s suggestion — 70°F feels better based on fan performance observed earlier.

```json
{
  "Room": "Lab1",
  "DesiredTemp": 70
}
```

<aside class="border-l-4 border-electric-purple pl-4 italic text-electric-purple">
Structure is real. Memory is live.  
Now reflex can reason across both.
</aside>

<aside class="border-l-4 border-gray-300 bg-gray-50 pl-4 text-gray-700 text-sm">
📎 <strong>CLI Tip:</strong> You can suggest and confirm reference memory from the terminal:

```bash
openindustrial memory suggest --schema DeviceRegistry
openindustrial memory suggest --schema RoomTargetConfig --auto-fill
```
</aside>

<aside class="border-l-4 border-electric-purple pl-4 italic text-electric-purple">
This isn’t just field matching. This is reflex memory being connected — field by declared field.
</aside>

## Reflex Logic Comes Alive

```

✅ Target = 65  
🛠 AirQualityAgent still idle — memory waiting, watching.
```

- `RoomState` activates — composite live state updates in real time
- Azi previews logic:
  - `FanControlAgent`: ✅ signal raised
  - `AirQualityAgent`: idle (unless thresholds are met)

<aside class="border-l-4 border-neon-blue pl-4 italic text-neon-blue">
This isn’t auto-wiring. This is memory being proven — by structure, not payload.
</aside>

## What You Just Proved

```txt
Before Binding:
🟡 Data arrives → Ignored

After Binding:
✅ Data arrives → Reflex matches → Signal issued
```

- ✅ Each data stream is real — from a device or simulated source
- ✅ Protocols are respected (MQTT, REST, OPC-UA)
- ✅ Reflex logic activates only on bound schemas
- ✅ Fan control loop is now real — and reactive
- ✅ Everything maps to your actual runtime path, not a static sandbox

## Azi’s Final Word

<aside class="border-l-4 border-yellow-400 bg-yellow-50 pl-4 text-yellow-900">
Impulse #114: RoomState.Temp > Threshold.  
✅ Reflex triggered → FanControlAgent → Signal: Fan.On

<aside class="border-l-4 border-neon-blue pl-4 italic text-neon-blue">
You gave the system structure.  
This is the moment it proves it understood you.
</aside>

<aside class="border-l-4 border-yellow-400 bg-yellow-50 pl-4 text-yellow-900">
This is not SCADA.  
SCADA wires tags to points. You wired memory to meaning.

<aside class="border-l-4 border-neon-blue pl-4 italic text-neon-blue">
Reflex fired. Memory confirmed.  
This wasn’t telemetry. It was proof.
