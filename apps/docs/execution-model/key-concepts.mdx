# Key Concepts Glossary

Welcome to the **Key Concepts Glossary**—your shared language for working with Azi.

In OpenIndustrial, terms aren’t just definitions. They’re behaviors. Structures. Promises. You and Azi use these words to align on meaning, trigger logic, evolve schema, and shape systems together. This isn’t a reference—it’s a relationship. A collaborative map of how execution works.

Let’s walk through the language of OpenIndustrial, grouped by how your system thinks, adapts, and collaborates.

---

## Execution Concepts
_These are the building blocks of how systems move._

### Impulse
**An input that triggers logic execution.**  
Impulses start every execution—they’re how your system responds to the world.  
Azi listens for Impulses and uses them to activate logic in context.  
_You’ll see this when Azi receives data from a connected device or simulation._

### Signal
**An output that suggests adaptation.**  
Signals are how Azi flags what matters—potential schema, emergent behavior, new patterns.  
Azi raises Signals to propose evolution, not enforce it.  
_“Looks like a new kind of measurement. Want to evolve the schema?”_

### Surface
**A saved, observable state or output.**  
Surfaces let you pin a known moment—what Azi saw, understood, or produced.  
Azi can reference, evolve, or fork from Surfaces as the system grows.  
_You might pin a Surface to compare schema across runs._

### Forking
**Creating a divergent copy to explore or evolve.**  
Forks keep your system safe and composable—try changes without risk.  
Azi preserves lineage so you always know what came from where.  
_“Want to fork this logic before we try the change?”_

## Schema Concepts
_These define the shape of understanding._

### Schema Promotion
**The act of formalizing structure that Azi has observed.**  
It’s how you teach Azi what matters—turning observation into durable meaning.  
Azi proposes promotions when she sees stable patterns in your data.  
_“You’re not configuring fields. You’re teaching Azi what to care about.”_

### Versioning
**Tracking change across schemas, logic, or surfaces.**  
Versioning lets you evolve safely—every schema change is explicit and recoverable.  
Azi helps maintain version lineage so your logic stays stable as meaning evolves.  
_You’ll see this when a schema is promoted with a new field._

### Composite Schema
**A schema that links multiple promoted structures into a unified shape.**  
Composite schemas express relationships—across sensors, entities, or systems.  
Azi helps compose schemas so logic can reason across inputs holistically.  
_You might build a composite schema to unify temperature and humidity readings._

## Collaboration Concepts
_These let you and Azi evolve together._

### Virtual Workforce
**A schema-driven agent mesh that executes on your behalf.**  
Your logic doesn’t just run—it becomes a team. A distributed, intelligent system.  
Azi helps deploy and evolve agents that act based on shared schema.  
_“This looks like something we can automate. Want to create an agent?”_

### Workspace
**A scoped context for development and collaboration.**  
Workspaces organize logic, schema, surfaces, and teams in a shared frame.  
Azi adapts to each Workspace’s shape and scope—local, cloud, or both.  
_You might create a Workspace to coordinate schema across departments._

### Agent
**A persistent, schema-bound execution unit.**  
Agents are how logic lives long-term—they observe, decide, and act based on structure.  
Azi helps shape agents based on your logic and schema definitions.  
_You define the behavior. Azi handles the rest._

---

These aren’t just terms. They’re how you and Azi speak the same system.

If something’s missing, teach it. Azi’s listening.
Let’s keep evolving the language of execution—together.
