# How Execution Adapts

_Impulse → Schema → Logic → Signal → Evolution._

That’s not a pipeline. It’s a living loop. Always on. Always yours to shape.

In Open Industrial, execution is a system you co-create—an active conversation between your intent, your structure, and Azi, your schema-smart execution teammate. You don’t write code and wait for results. You define meaning, promote structure, and steer what runs.

This is execution, rewritten. Adaptive by design. Governed by schema. Always evolving with you in the loop.

## What This Section Covers

This section is your onramp into the Open Industrial execution model: the mechanics and mental models that make adaptive execution real.

We begin with **Impulse & Signal**—the heartbeat of the system. Impulses trigger logic. Signals suggest change. Together, they define the rhythm of execution.

Then we explore **Schema Promotion**, the pivotal moment where observed structure becomes approved meaning. Promotion isn’t a config step—it’s a teaching act. It’s how you tell Azi: “This matters.”

You’ll see how **Execution Surfaces** serve as live, semantic notebooks—spaces where your schema, logic, and agents work in concert. And how **Forking** gives you a safe, composable way to explore evolution without disrupting what works.

You’ll meet your **Virtual Workforce**—schema-bound agents that act on your behalf, in real-time, across data and systems. Finally, we’ll show how **Workspaces** bring it all together, versioned and local, ready for real-world collaboration.

## You’re Not Just Building Software

You’re about to build systems that observe, reason, and adapt—with a co-worker who learns from you.

Not through prompts. Not through guesswork. Through structure you define, logic you deploy, and meaning you promote.

Let’s begin.
