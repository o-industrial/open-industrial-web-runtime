# Schema Promotion: How Meaning Is Formalized

That question is more than pattern recognition. It’s a request for meaning. 
And it begins one of the most important conversations you’ll ever have with Azi.

Schema Promotion isn’t just a technical gesture—it’s a trust signal. It’s how you say: *Yes, this matters. Treat it as real.*

It’s not syntax. It’s semantics. You’re not configuring—you’re coaching.

---

## What Is Schema Promotion?

Schema Promotion is the moment where you formalize structure and intent.
Azi proposes a schema based on the shape of incoming Impulses. But only you can promote it—confirming that structure, naming the fields, and setting them in motion.

You’re not labeling raw data.
You’re defining the truth your system will operate on.

---

## Why It Matters

Until you promote a schema:
- Logic can’t bind to it
- Queries don’t resolve against it
- Agents ignore it

Promotion is the activation point. It’s when data becomes usable, and when surfaces can respond to what’s been learned.

It’s also what keeps your system safe. Nothing is ever assumed. Azi waits for your approval before anything gets locked in.

> _“You promote. I remember. Together, we move.” – Azi_

## How You Promote

When Azi sees a new pattern, she proposes a candidate schema:

```json
// Before:
{
  "field": "tempRaw"
}
```

You review it. Name it. Confirm types. Define its intent:

```json
// After:
{
  "field": "temperature",
  "unit": "C",
  "promoted": true
}
```

This is a declarative act. Promotion is always explicit, versioned, and traceable.

You can:
- Promote new fields
- Update existing schemas (with diff tracking)
- Fork variants for parallel exploration

Azi never changes structure without you. That’s the trust model.

## What Happens After Promotion

Once promoted, your schema becomes the foundation of:
- **Logic Binding** – Neurons and circuits attach to known structure
- **Surface Composition** – Dashboards and queries adapt automatically
- **Agent Routing** – Virtual workers respond based on type and content

Your schema is now:
- **Versioned** – Track every change
- **Forkable** – Experiment without risk
- **Composable** – Build new structures from what you’ve defined
- **Traceable** – Know who made what real, and when

## Real Example: `SensorReading`

Azi sees this stream:

```json
{
  "device_id": "abc-123",
  "temperature": 72.4,
  "location": "north-lab"
}
```

She proposes:
> _"Promote this as `SensorReading`?”_

You review. Approve. Confirm the structure. Now:
- A rule triggers when temperature > 75
- A dashboard loads all `SensorReading` entries
- Azi routes future data with confidence

All from a single yes: **you promoted it.**

## Reuse with Schema Packs

Once promoted, your schemas aren’t just local—they’re portable.

**Schema Packs** let you:
- Share structure across teams
- Reuse logic across surfaces
- Version and export your knowledge

Promoted schemas become part of your shared language.

## The Foundation of Everything

Schema Promotion is the beginning of real collaboration.
It’s how Azi learns your world—not by guessing, but by listening.

Everything downstream—surfaces, agents, forks—flows from what you promote.

You’re not just organizing data.
You’re shaping execution.

You’re teaching Azi what matters.
