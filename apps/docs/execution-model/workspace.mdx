# Workspace: Local Development + Team Context

> _A Workspace is where you and Azi build together. It’s where context lives._

A Workspace in OpenIndustrial isn’t just a folder on disk—it’s a shared memory for your system.
It captures every evolving piece of structure, logic, and execution state in one composable container.
It’s where you teach Azi what matters, observe system behavior in real-time, and promote structure your team can rely on.

> _"This agent is drifting from its last known pattern. Want me to raise a Signal?"_ — Azi

## What’s Inside

At any moment, your Workspace holds:
- **Schemas** — Observed, versioned, promoted. This is how you teach Azi.
- **Agents** — Executable logic units bound to structure and tracked across forks.
- **Surfaces** — Live or pinned execution states that reflect how your system behaves.
- **Schema Packs** — Reusable bundles of logic and structure shared across Workspaces.
- **Metadata** — Workspace manifest, CLI config, and profiles that define your execution environment.

This is more than version control. It’s structured, explainable memory—with a pulse.

## How It’s Used

You start locally—but everything is built to scale across simulation, test, and production.

Run `oictl` commands to:
- Simulate input streams (Impulse)
- Observe behavior (Signal)
- Trigger, inspect, and refine logic in context

> These commands shape logic. Not just files.

Azi watches your development loop:
- Flagging structural changes
- Proposing schema
- Simulating surface behavior
- Raising signals when forks drift

This is the core dev loop in OpenIndustrial—observable, adaptive, and grounded in real context.

## Why It Matters

A Workspace isn’t just a local dev tool—it’s a reproducible, shareable execution environment.
It’s cold-start ready. Git-connected. Portable across laptops, edge devices, and cloud runtime.

Your whole team collaborates here:
- **Engineers** define and test logic
- **Analysts** review, validate, and promote schema
- **Operators** observe surfaces and raise questions
- **Azi** adapts in real-time, suggests structure, and flags drift

You’re not managing a backlog of YAMLs.
You’re growing a living system that explains itself.

> _"You onboard teammates into a Workspace, not a wiki."_

## Safe to Fork, Ready to Promote

Workspaces are built for safe iteration:
- Fork to test logic variations
- Simulate alternate environments
- Compare agent performance
- Train new teammates or agents

Every fork retains lineage.
Every schema change is diffable.
Every promotion is explainable.
