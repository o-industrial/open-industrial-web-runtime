## Add Reference Data

Before Azi can think — she has to know where she is.

In the last step, we built a reflex: if `TemperatureSensor` reads over 80, turn on the fan. Simple, direct... but blind.

This page introduces **reference data**: user-defined schemas that **give structure to context**.

<aside class="border-l-4 border-neon-blue pl-4 italic text-neon-blue">
Is this temperature… or voltage? Azi isn’t sure — yet.
</aside>

We call these **Reference Schemas** — structures that define expectations, not events. They enable logic that adapts based on room, schedule, or system condition.

### Teach Azi About Devices

We’ll start by teaching Azi what devices exist in our environment, and where they live.

This is your **DeviceDirectorySchema**:

```json
{
  "ID": { "type": "string", "primary": true },
  "FriendlyName": { "type": "string" },
  "Room": { "type": "string" }
}
```

Just like with `TemperatureSensor`, these schemas are versioned. Changes can be tracked, forked, and rolled forward safely.

Use Azi’s schema editor to promote this structure.

<aside class="border-l-4 border-neon-blue pl-4 italic text-neon-blue">
Azi doesn’t assume what matters. You teach her, field by field.
</aside>

Then, enter two rows of data:

```json
[
  { "ID": "temperature-sensor-001", "FriendlyName": "Temp Sensor - Lab1", "Room": "Lab1" },
  { "ID": "fan-controller-001", "FriendlyName": "Exhaust Fan - Lab1", "Room": "Lab1" }
]
```

<aside class="border-l-4 border-neon-blue pl-4 italic text-neon-blue">
This is like a directory of devices — but versioned, forkable, and collaborative.
</aside>

### Teach Azi What "Good" Means

Now we’ll define your **RoomThresholdConfigSchema** — expectations per room.

```json
{
  "Room": { "type": "string", "primary": true },
  "DesiredTemp": { "type": "number" }
}
```

Promote this schema, then add a single entry:

```json
[
  { "Room": "Lab1", "DesiredTemp": 72 }
]
```

<aside class="border-l-4 border-neon-blue pl-4 italic text-neon-blue">
Until now, your system has been reacting in the dark. This is the first time it sees a room — and understands what “comfortable” means.
</aside>

### Azi Sees the Table

Azi auto-generates a table UI for each promoted schema. You can sort, edit, and filter directly — but more importantly, Azi now understands this structure.

> This isn’t new data — it’s new meaning.

<aside class="border-l-4 border-neon-blue pl-4 italic text-neon-blue">
Azi now understands the *relationship* between data streams and reference expectations. This unlocks her ability to propose composite views — like `RoomState v1`.
</aside>

She can now **join** real-time telemetry against this reference:
- Is this device in Lab1?
- What’s Lab1’s preferred temperature?
- Is the room within range — or not?

<aside class="border-l-4 border-neon-blue pl-4 italic text-neon-blue">
What if a device moves rooms? What if two schemas disagree? Azi will flag conflicts — but **you define resolution**.
</aside>

### Structure Becomes State

In Open Industrial, a state schema reflects current conditions — like telemetry joined with targets.

RoomState v1 will let agents check: “Is this room within range?” — and decide what to do next.

Here’s what a simplified joined structure might look like:

```json
{
  "DeviceID": "temperature-sensor-001",
  "Room": "Lab1",
  "CurrentTemp": 80,
  "DesiredTemp": 72
}
```

To visualize how these schemas relate:

```
[TemperatureSensor] --(ID)--> [DeviceDirectory] --(Room)--> [RoomThresholdConfig]
                                       ↓
                                   [RoomState]
```

Here’s what reasoning can look like in action:

```json
{
  "if": {
    "RoomState.CurrentTemp > RoomState.DesiredTemp + 3"
  },
  "then": {
    "Activate": "fan-controller-001"
  }
}
```

> Azi proposes a derived view: `RoomState` — showing current + target per room, live.

In the UI, Azi renders:
```json
{
  "Room": "Lab1",
  "CurrentTemp": 80,
  "DesiredTemp": 72,
  "InRange": false
}
```
And flags: _"Lab1 is 8 degrees above target. Would you like to add a rule?”_

<aside class="border-l-4 border-neon-blue pl-4 italic text-neon-blue">
As data accumulates, Azi can propose evolved schemas — like `RoomState v2`, separating weekday vs weekend targets.
</aside>

In the next step, you’ll promote a composite schema: `RoomState`. It combines telemetry and reference into a single, observable structure.

> From here on, Azi doesn’t just react. She **reasons**.

Dev Tip: All schema operations can also be scripted via the Open Industrial CLI or SDK.
