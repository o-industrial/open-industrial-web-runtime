# Why Open Industrial

Most tools break under pressure. Not because they’re badly built—but because they were never designed to evolve.

Dashboards crack when the schema changes. ETL pipelines collapse when one input shifts. LLMs hallucinate when prompts aren’t perfect.

These aren’t just bugs. They’re symptoms of a deeper flaw: the old model treats data like a dead thing. Static. Predefined. Disconnected from execution.

We built Open Industrial because we knew the problem wasn’t your insight—it was your system.

You just did something subtle but powerful. You didn’t write code in a notebook, or configure a dashboard. You defined a schema — and you deployed logic.

That logic **ran**. In the open. In a shared model. It reflected structure, not guesswork. And it responded — not blindly, but as a **reflex**, scoped to structure and surface. This wasn’t an always-on poller. It was a structure-bound wait — triggered by truth.

This ran on your surface — scoped to a structure, versioned to a moment.

> _You can inspect and edit surface bindings in the `Surfaces` tab of your workspace._

## Observation vs Execution

Most tools summarize. Dashboards collect. Alerts ping. But they don’t act. And if they do, it’s a brittle webhook or a hardcoded automation that breaks as soon as your data shifts.

Open Industrial flips this:
- Agents execute logic tied to structure
- Schema is promoted, versioned, and confirmed
- Signals don’t act — they ask

```js
// Azi asks:
// "Should the fan turn on?"
if (temperature > 80) then activate("fan")
```

This isn’t magic — it’s governance. In Open Industrial, **execution is the product**.

> _You’ll see your first signal raised soon — when Azi proposes a schema update based on drift._

```js
// A signal might be raised when:
// - Confidence in an action drops
// - A pattern diverges from expected logic
// - You’ve forked an agent, and one path outperforms the other
```

## Why Old Tools Break

<p><span class="font-semibold text-indigo-700 dark:text-indigo-300">Thinking Tip:</span> Ever debug an automation only to find the schema changed upstream? That’s schema drift.</p>

Old stacks fragment:
- ETL pipelines hard-code logic
- Notebooks hide fragile experiments
- Prompts guess at meaning

And most critically — they have no memory. Your decisions, your structure, your logic — it vanishes into scripts and config files.

It’s a system that burns time and loses trust.

_In most systems, structure fades. In this one, it forms lineage._

## How Open Industrial Holds Together

With Open Industrial:
- **Promotion is governance** — you decide what structure matters
- **Versioning is evolution** — the system can fork, roll back, compare
- **Forking is CI/CD** — you can test change without breaking reality

Everything you define becomes part of a composable, inspectable model.

```js
// When you promoted your schema...
structure = version("v1") // Immutable. Traced. Auditable.

// When you deployed your logic...
agent = create("fan_control", logic)

// When Azi ran it...
result = agent.run({ temperature: 83 })
```

Every schema you promote gets a version ID, a history trail, and a replayable trace. If an agent fails, you can rewind the logic — not guess at the config.

> _You can inspect schema versions in your Workspace → Schemas tab. Every promotion carries a version ID, visible in the top-right corner._

> _To explore via CLI:_
```bash
# View your promoted schemas
openindustrial schemas list

# View version history
openindustrial schemas history TemperatureSensor

# View agent logic trace
openindustrial agents trace FanControlAgent

# Roll back a schema promotion
openindustrial schemas rollback v2
```

<p><span class="font-semibold text-indigo-700 dark:text-indigo-300">Thinking Tip:</span> Need to revert? You can roll back to any schema version in the UI or CLI. All agents trace their run lineage to the schema they used.</p>

Schema isn’t just config — it’s how you collaborate.
It becomes shared language. Every field is traceable, promotable, and adaptive.

This isn’t prompt engineering. This is **semantic collaboration**.

> _You’ll fork your first agent soon — comparing its logic to your current one, side by side. No changes go live until you approve._

Forking allows two versions of the same logic to run side by side. You’ll compare outcomes — and promote the one that performs best. The system keeps track of both.

> _Once structure is promoted, logic inherits its meaning. Get it wrong, and every downstream action will trust the shape you confirmed._

The system didn’t just respond. It understood. And it remembered.

## What Comes Next

You now have a stable structure. You deployed logic. You saw it act.

Next, you’ll add **reference data** — context that lets agents reason beyond a single sensor or room.

This is how you stop writing agents for each device — and start building logic that scales across rooms, patterns, and time.

Reference data isn’t more inputs — it’s how agents think across time, space, and pattern.
