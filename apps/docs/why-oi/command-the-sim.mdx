# Command the Sim

> *"You send a command. The structure changes."*

Until now, Azi has observed passively. You’ve taught through what already exists.

But what happens when you introduce something new?

## Trigger a New Input

In your Surface, locate `humidity-sensor-001`. It’s paused by default. Click **Enable Emission**.

Though it looks like a toggle, this is actually a command — one your agents could issue too. Within seconds, the simulator emits a new structure:

```json
{ "ID": "humidity-sensor-001", "humidity": 74.2 }
```

<aside class="border-l-4 border-neon-blue pl-4 italic text-neon-blue">
This looks like a new field: <code>humidity</code>. Want to promote it as <code>Humidity</code>?
</aside>

## Promote the `HumiditySensor` Schema

Azi detects the new field and proposes a schema:

```json
{
  "ID": { "source": "connectionId", "type": "string", "primary": true },
  "Humidity": { "source": "humidity", "type": "number", "unit": "%" }
}
```

Click **Promote Schema** to confirm. Azi saves it as `HumiditySensor v1`.

> The raw field is lowercase: `humidity`. Azi normalizes it to title-case in schema promotion — you can override this if needed.

## Update the Device Directory

For composite logic to track humidity devices, the `DeviceDirectorySchema` must also evolve. Previously, it looked like this:

```json
{
  "ID": { "type": "string", "primary": true },
  "FriendlyName": { "type": "string" },
  "Room": { "type": "string" }
}
```

Now, edit it to include the type of each device:

```json
{
  "ID": { "type": "string", "primary": true },
  "FriendlyName": { "type": "string" },
  "Room": { "type": "string" },
  "DeviceType": { "type": "string" }
}
```

Promote this schema version — Azi saves it as `DeviceDirectorySchema v2`.

Then, add a new row for the humidity sensor:

```json
{
  "ID": "humidity-sensor-001",
  "FriendlyName": "Humidity Sensor - Lab1",
  "Room": "Lab1",
  "DeviceType": "humidity"
}
```

<aside class="border-l-4 border-neon-blue pl-4 italic text-neon-blue">
This keeps Azi’s joins sharp. She knows exactly what each device does — and where.
</aside>

Once the schema is promoted, Azi reviews existing records. Because <code>DeviceType</code> is a new required field, she highlights any entries that need a backfill:

<aside class="border-l-4 border-neon-blue pl-4 italic text-neon-blue">
I noticed some records in <code>DeviceDirectory</code> are missing a <code>DeviceType</code>. Want to patch them now?
</aside>

Use the quick-edit UI or batch input to add missing values. Azi will validate them as updates are saved.

<aside class="border-l-4 border-neon-blue pl-4 italic text-neon-blue">
When required fields are missing, Azi automatically renders an inline quick-edit view — no need to scan logs or manually validate.
</aside>

<aside class="border-l-4 border-neon-blue pl-4 italic text-neon-blue">
Dev Tip: Use <code>openindustrial schemas update</code> or <code>schemas diff</code> in the CLI to compare versions or backfill data programmatically.
</aside>

## Update the Threshold Configuration

New structure means new context. Update your reference config to support humidity-based logic.

### Edit the Schema

Find `RoomThresholdConfig`, then click **Edit Schema**. Add a new field:

```json
{ "HumidityThreshold": "number" }
```

Promote this update — Azi versions it as `RoomThresholdConfig v2`.

### Input the Updated Values

Use Azi’s auto-generated view to provide new configuration values:

```json
[
  { "Room": "Lab1", "DesiredTemp": 72, "HumidityThreshold": 60 }
]
```

Click **Save Data**.

## Azi Proposes `RoomState v2`

With the updated reference schema and new telemetry, Azi assembles a recomposed composite:

```json
{
  "Room": "Lab1",
  "Temperature": 83.2,
  "DesiredTemp": 72,
  "FanDevice": "fan-controller-001",
  "FanPower": "off",
  "Humidity": 74.2,
  "HumidityThreshold": 60
}
```

<aside class="border-l-4 border-neon-blue pl-4 italic text-neon-blue">
RoomState has evolved — should I propose <code>RoomState v2</code>?
</aside>

Click **Promote Schema**. Azi handles versioning and preserves lineage. Your system now interprets not just what’s happening — but whether that state is acceptable across multiple dimensions.

<aside class="border-l-4 border-neon-blue pl-4 italic text-neon-blue">
Agents using <code>RoomState</code> continue functioning — they’ll now receive additional context, like humidity and thresholds, unless locked to a specific version.

## Before & After

**Previous Structure:**
```
[TemperatureSensor] → [DeviceDirectory] → [RoomThresholdConfig]
                                      ↓
                                [RoomState v1]
```

**After Adding Humidity:**
```
[HumiditySensor] ─┐
                  ↓
[TemperatureSensor] → [DeviceDirectory v2] → [RoomThresholdConfig v2]
                                      ↓
                                [RoomState v2]
```

> *💡 Thinky Tip: You don’t just observe evolution. You trigger it.*
