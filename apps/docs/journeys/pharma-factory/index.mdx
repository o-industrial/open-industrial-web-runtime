# Pharma Factory Simulation Journey

_You’ve seen what journeys unlock. Now, let’s walk into the first one — where failure isn’t hypothetical._

**Batch 112A just failed compliance. No one can explain why.**

Welcome to the **Pharma Factory Simulation** — your gateway to production-grade execution with Open Industrial. This isn’t a demo. It’s a deployable system blueprint, stress-tested against regulatory pressure, audit trails, and SOP-grade operational control.

```bash
# Simulate a real runtime. Audit every reflex.
oi journey fork pharma-factory --replay --commit-signals
```

This is where the journey begins. This is the first journey. And it begins inside a system that has to work — not just simulate.

You’ve just explored what makes an Execution Journey different: forkable, governed, exportable. Now we make that real — inside a factory that can’t afford failure.

How you modernize is your call:
- 🧩 **Track A – Hybrid OT Integration**: Layer Open Industrial alongside your existing systems.
- 🛠 **Track B – Full System Replacement**: Build the entire stack from first principles using OI primitives.

Both tracks lead to live, governable runtime systems. You own the logic. You promote the memory. You define the future.

  In the old world, your factory would’ve failed silently. Here, every reflex is accountable — because you wrote the logic.

## One Factory, Two Futures

You’ll build against a simulated pharmaceutical environment — a high-stakes setting where traceability and real-time response aren’t optional. Inside, you’ll orchestrate logic across:

- Cleanrooms
- Batch reactors
- HVAC and environmental control
- Air quality sensors
- QA gating zones

Pharma wasn’t chosen by accident. It demands:
- Strict runtime governance
- SOP-compliant reflex logging
- GxP-ready memory artifacts
- Drift tracking tied to agent logic

Every reflex-triggered event is logged with schema version, agent hash, and input impulse — ready for export to your compliance system.

```json
{
  "agent": "Zone2AirflowReflex",
  "input": "delta.pressure=7.3",
  "reflex": "open-intake-valve",
  "drift": "none",
  "version": "v3.1",
  "approvedBy": "runtime.policy.yaml"
}
```

## Pick Your Track

### 🧩 Hybrid OT Integration (Track A)
You already have an industrial backbone — DeltaV, HighByte, MES, SCADA. This path overlays:
- Runtime memory and reflexes
- Audit trails and diff tracking
- Governance and schema promotion

Open Industrial becomes the connective tissue — no rip-and-replace needed.

### 🛠 Full System Replacement (Track B)
This track assumes nothing. From the wiring layer up, you:
- Define schemas from physical reality
- Fork and promote runtime memory
- Deploy surfaces and agent logic at the edge
- Operate as a sovereign runtime — governed by you, not us

Both tracks cover:
- Schema promotion + reference memory
- Reflex agents + signal behavior
- Surface deployment + runtime rehydration
- Replay, diffing, audit, and drift governance
- Team workflows and UI exposure

oi runtime show pharma-factory --snapshot
```

## What You’ll Build

- ✅ A real, multi-room factory system
- 🧠 Forkable runtime: a versioned system you own — schema, surfaces, logic, and history — ready to clone, diff, and rehydrate across any node
- 🔁 Reflex agents with drift resilience
- 🚀 Edge-deployable runtime snapshots
- 👥 Role-based observability with policy enforcement

The path you pick today defines how your team governs runtime tomorrow. Each journey sets the foundation for versioned logic, portable memory, and long-term compliance across facilities.

## Along the Way, You’ll Learn

- How structure becomes memory
- Multi-surface rehydration
- Governance at runtime (via runtime.policy.yaml and reflex audit trails)
- Diffing, arbitration, and drift recovery
- Forkable deployments and runtime promotion
- Defining what’s allowed to drift — and what isn’t

  This isn’t just your system — it’s your team’s. Reflex approvals, schema diffs, and runtime snapshots are all version-controlled. Operational trust becomes team-readable.
</aside>

Zone 3’s airflow threshold changed last week — but the reflex agent didn’t. You’ll use runtime.policy.yaml to decide: accept the drift, or raise a signal.

Every reflex commit, schema diff, and runtime snapshot can live in Git. Your runtime doesn’t just work — it’s auditable by your whole team.

## Your System. Not Ours.

Every input you author becomes structure. Every reaction becomes logic. By the end of this journey, you won’t just operate a factory — you’ll have encoded its judgment.

This journey doesn’t end with a demo — it ends with a real, forkable runtime.

Every schema, signal, and reflex you author becomes part of a sovereign execution contract.

This is your system. You didn’t just configure it — you made it alive. You tuned it. You govern its every move.

<aside class="border-l-4 border-blue-400 pl-4 italic text-blue-400 mt-4">
  This journey will teach you more than reflex logic. It will shift how you see systems — not as tools you configure, but as memory-driven entities you co-author.
</aside>

This isn’t just your system today. It’s your runtime tomorrow — shaped by everything it sees, stores, and promotes. And it remembers who shaped it.

🛠 You’ll use the CLI (`oi`) and plain YAML. That’s it. No proprietary DSLs. No lock-in. Just versioned, reflexive logic you own.
