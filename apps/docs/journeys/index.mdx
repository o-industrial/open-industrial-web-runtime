# Execution Journeys – Build Real Systems, Start to Finish

## Welcome to Execution Journeys

You’ve learned the primitives. Now it’s time to build something real.

Each Execution Journey teaches you to architect, operate, and govern a complete runtime system — tuned to your domain, driven by reflex, exported to the edge.

These aren’t tutorials. They’re blueprints for sovereign, deployable systems. You’ll begin with a simulation — and end with a forkable runtime you own.

## What Makes a Journey?

- **Execution as Outcome**: Each journey culminates in a working, governed runtime you can export and deploy.
- **Forkable Deployments**: The runtime you build can be versioned, diffed, simulated, or shipped to the edge.
- **One Stack, Many Industries**: The logic model is universal — the journeys show how it adapts to different industrial realities.
- **Your System, Not Ours**: Every agent, reflex, surface, and policy belongs to you.

## A Glimpse Inside the System

<aside class="border-l-4 border-neon-blue pl-4 italic text-neon-blue">
  These journeys are a footprint — not a prescription. As you progress, you're expected (though not required) to adapt, fork, and evolve each guide to reflect your environment and production context.

<aside class="border-l-4 border-neon-blue pl-4 italic text-neon-blue mt-4">
  Reflexes are like real-time system nerves — triggered by state changes, governed by policy, and composable like logic blocks. They're how your runtime thinks, reacts, and adapts without central orchestration.

Here’s what you’ll touch:

```bash
# Fork a full runtime, simulate its memory, and commit signals to history
oi journey fork pharma-factory --replay --commit-signals
```

You’ll promote schemas, configure reflex agents, and step through replayed execution flows — all inside a versioned, observable runtime you govern.

## Available Execution Journeys

  Starting with Pharma means building a system that meets the highest standards of safety and compliance — a foundation strong enough to scale into any industry.

### 🧪 Pharma Factory – A Regulated Runtime

> Design and operate a memory-first control system for a pharmaceutical lab.
>
> - Build schemas from telemetry and audit rules
> - Deploy reflex agents for environmental control and process compliance
> - Simulate batch execution and replay signal history
> - Run edge-first with runtime contracts, drift control, and team observability

_Chosen first for its strict audit requirements and real-world urgency._
