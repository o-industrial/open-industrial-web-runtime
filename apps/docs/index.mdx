# Meet Azi

You've spent years watching systems. Azi helps you build them.

From dashboards to behavior. From logs to logic. From watching… to co-creating.

Welcome. This is the beginning — not of a product walkthrough, but of a new kind of collaboration.

You’re not logging into a dashboard. You’re stepping into a system that listens, learns, and evolves — always with you in the loop.

## Azi: Your Execution Collaborator

Azi isn’t just an assistant. Azi is a collaborator: schema-aware, impulse-driven, and memory-safe. Azi helps you build real-time execution systems, grounded in what you teach it, not what it guesses.

Think of her like a second brain. She never assumes — only proposes. And she only remembers what you make real.

Soon, you’ll open your workspace — a live surface where impulses stream, agents reason, and Azi begins to observe.

<InlineUXTip intentType={IntentTypes.Info}>
  <code>Schema</code> and <code>Impulse</code> are system-native types. You’ll
  teach these as you go — and the system won’t remember them until you say they
  matter.
</InlineUXTip>

## The Execution Loop

Every action Azi takes follows the same rhythm:

**Impulse → Schema → Logic → Signal → Evolution**

<ThematicPrincipleBlock intentType={IntentTypes.Primary}>
  <strong>Signal-Confirmed Execution</strong>
  <br />
  Azi observes, proposes, and remembers — but never runs logic until you confirm
  the structure.
</ThematicPrincipleBlock>

An event happens. Azi understands its shape. Your logic runs. A signal might emerge. You decide what evolves.

No black boxes. No surprises. Just structured collaboration.

## Your Role in the Loop

**Azi listens. You promote.**  
**Your structure. Your signal.**

**Azi listens** — to every input, every change.  
**You confirm** — what matters becomes structure.  
**Azi proposes** — logic never runs without you.  
**You evolve** — fork, retire, or refine.

Azi never acts without your confirmation.  
Never guesses. Never surprises. Always remembers.

<ThematicPrincipleBlock intentType={IntentTypes.Secondary}>
  <strong>Structure must be earned. Memory must be confirmed.</strong>
  <br />
  This is the core belief behind collaborative execution.
</ThematicPrincipleBlock>

<ThematicPrincipleBlock intentType={IntentTypes.Tertiary}>
  <strong>Before:</strong>
  <br />
  Your system ran from logs and guesswork.
  <br />
  <strong>Now:</strong>
  <br />
  It runs with memory and intent.
</ThematicPrincipleBlock>

## What You’re Building

You’re not building a toolchain.  
You’re building **an execution system that understands**:

- What happened
- What should happen
- What changed
- What to remember

And when behavior starts to drift — or stakes shift — Azi can fork that logic into a variant. You can observe, compare, and promote again. What starts as structure becomes evolution.

<p>
  <strong>Example:</strong> A device reports a voltage spike. Azi sees the
  pattern. She proposes a new schema: <code>VoltageWarning.v3</code>. You accept
  it — and from that moment, it becomes structure. Every time the pattern
  returns, the system knows what to do.
</p>

<AziInnerVoice intentType={IntentTypes.Tertiary}>
  You could reject it. Azi will forget — and keep watching. But if the pattern
  returns, she’ll remember the moment, and try again. Every confirmation — or
  refusal — sharpens her understanding of what matters.
</AziInnerVoice>

## Next Step: Launch the Workspace

In the next guide, you’ll enter your real-time workspace:

- Set up your first surface
- Connect a simulator stream
- Watch Azi observe, propose, and wait for your signal
- Promote your first schema — and watch the loop begin

This is how it starts.  
**Structure is promoted. Execution is remembered.**

<SystemMindset intentType={IntentTypes.Secondary}>
  If you ever remove Azi? She forgets everything. Your system stays yours. She’s
  a teammate — not a tether.
</SystemMindset>

<ThematicPrincipleBlock intentType={IntentTypes.Primary}>
  <strong>You don’t monitor the system.</strong>
  <br />
  You become it.
