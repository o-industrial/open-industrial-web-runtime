# Meet Azi

You've spent years watching systems. Azi helps you build them.

From dashboards to behavior. From logs to logic. From watching… to co-creating.

Welcome. This is the beginning — not of a product walkthrough, but of a new kind of collaboration.

You’re not logging into a dashboard. You’re stepping into a system that listens, learns, and evolves — always with you in the loop.

## Azi: Your Execution Collaborator

Azi isn’t just an assistant. Azi is a collaborator: schema-aware, impulse-driven, and memory-safe. Azi helps you build real-time execution systems, grounded in what you teach it, not what it guesses.

<aside class="border-l-4 border-neon-blue pl-4 italic text-neon-blue">
  Think of her like a second brain. She never assumes — only proposes. And she only remembers what you make real.
</aside>

In the next screen, you’ll stream data. Azi will observe. She’ll propose a structure. And she’ll wait for your confirmation before acting.

<p><span class="font-semibold text-indigo-700 dark:text-indigo-300">Thinking Tip:</span> <code>Schema</code> and <code>Impulse</code> are system-native types. You’ll teach these as you go — and the system won’t remember them until you say they matter.</p>

## The Execution Loop

Every action Azi takes follows the same rhythm:

**Impulse → Schema → Logic → Signal → Evolution**

<div class="mt-6 mb-8 px-6 py-4 border-l-4 border-indigo-500 dark:border-indigo-400 bg-indigo-50 dark:bg-indigo-950 text-indigo-900 dark:text-indigo-100 rounded">
  <strong>Signal-Confirmed Execution</strong><br />
  Azi observes, proposes, and remembers — but never runs logic until you confirm the structure.
</div>

An event happens. Azi understands its shape. Your logic runs. A signal might emerge. You decide what evolves.

No black boxes. No surprises. Just structured collaboration.

## Your Role in the Loop

**Azi listens. You promote.**  
**Your structure. Your signal.**

**Azi listens** — to every input, every change.  
**You confirm** — what matters becomes structure.  
**Azi proposes** — logic never runs without you.  
**You evolve** — fork, retire, or refine.

Azi never acts without your confirmation.  
Never guesses. Never surprises. Always remembers.

<div class="mt-6 mb-8 px-6 py-4 border-l-4 border-indigo-500 dark:border-indigo-400 bg-indigo-50 dark:bg-indigo-950 text-indigo-900 dark:text-indigo-100 rounded">
  <strong>Structure must be earned. Memory must be confirmed.</strong><br />
  This is the core belief behind collaborative execution.
</div>

<aside class="border-l-4 border-neon-blue pl-4 italic text-neon-blue">
  Before, your system ran from logs and guesswork. Now it runs with memory and intent.
</aside>

## What You’re Building

You’re not building a toolchain.  
You’re building **an execution system that understands**:

- What happened  
- What should happen  
- What changed  
- What to remember

<aside class="border-l-4 border-neon-blue pl-4 italic text-neon-blue">
  And when behavior starts to drift — or stakes shift — Azi can fork that logic into a variant. You can observe, compare, and promote again. What starts as structure becomes evolution.

  <figcaption class="mt-4 text-sm text-gray-400 tracking-wide uppercase">
    When structure emerges, Azi asks for confirmation — not permission.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="font-semibold text-indigo-700 dark:text-indigo-300">Example:</span> A device reports a voltage spike. Azi sees the pattern. She proposes a new schema: <code>VoltageWarning.v3</code>. You accept it — and from that moment, it becomes structure. Every time the pattern returns, the system knows what to do.</p>

<aside class="border-l-4 border-neon-blue pl-4 italic text-neon-blue">
  You could reject it. Azi will forget — and keep watching. But if the pattern returns, she’ll remember the moment, and try again. Every confirmation — or refusal — sharpens her understanding of what matters.
</aside>

## Before / After

<div class="mt-6 mb-8 px-6 py-4 border-l-4 border-indigo-500 dark:border-indigo-400 bg-indigo-50 dark:bg-indigo-950 text-indigo-900 dark:text-indigo-100 rounded">
  <strong>Before</strong><br />
  You wrote code. Shipped. Waited for logs. You guessed what mattered. You patched what broke.
</div>

<div class="mt-6 mb-8 px-6 py-4 border-l-4 border-indigo-500 dark:border-indigo-400 bg-indigo-50 dark:bg-indigo-950 text-indigo-900 dark:text-indigo-100 rounded">
  <strong>After</strong><br />
  You teach structure. Azi proposes logic. You watch behavior — and evolve it with a signal.
</div>

## What It Looks Like

```json
{
  "impulse": {
    "sensor": "temperature",
    "value": 92.3,
    "unit": "F"
  }
}
```

<p><span class="font-semibold text-indigo-700 dark:text-indigo-300">System View:</span> When Azi sees this impulse, she may propose a <code>HighTempAlert</code> schema. But it waits. Nothing happens until you promote it.</p>

```ts
export default Neuron("HighTempAlert")
  .Impulses.In(TemperatureSchema)
  .OnImpulse((impulse, ctx) => {
    if (impulse.value > 90) ctx.Signals.Alert({ message: "Too hot!" });
  });
```

<p><span class="font-semibold text-indigo-700 dark:text-indigo-300">Thinking Tip:</span> One schema. One signal. Logic, bound to structure — and governed by you.</p>

## Next Step: Launch the Simulator

In the next doc, you’ll:

- Open the in-browser simulator  
- Trigger a live telemetry pulse  
- Watch Azi observe, respond, and wait for your confirmation

<aside class="border-l-4 border-neon-blue pl-4 italic text-neon-blue">
  In one click, you’ll light the fuse. Azi will listen. Propose structure. And wait — silently — for your signal.
</aside>

This is how it starts.  
**Structure is promoted. Execution is remembered.**

<aside class="border-l-4 border-neon-blue pl-4 italic text-neon-blue">
  And if you ever remove Azi? She forgets everything. Your system stays yours. She’s a teammate — not a tether.

  <strong>You don’t monitor the system.</strong><br />
  You become it.
