# Welcome to Open Industrial

<ThematicPrincipleBlock intentType={IntentTypes.Primary}>
  Industrial data is no longer locked in silos. With Open Industrial, it becomes
  observable, queryable, and shareable â€” from the moment it arrives.
</ThematicPrincipleBlock>

---

## What Is This?

Open Industrial is your **cloud-native integration surface** for OT and industrial telemetry.

Itâ€™s not a dashboard. Itâ€™s not a script runner. Itâ€™s not a custom ingestion tool.

Itâ€™s a governed, tenant-owned runtime that connects your machines to insight â€” and lets you query real-time data with natural language.

---

## What Does It Do?

- ðŸŸ¢ **Ingest** from OPC UA, MQTT, HTTP drop, and simulators
- ðŸŸ¢ **Stream** live telemetry into structured Azure-native storage
- ðŸŸ¢ **Observe** data as it flows â€” typed, versioned, and governed
- ðŸŸ¢ **Query** using REST, GraphQL, or just plain English
- ðŸŸ¢ **Secure** everything inside your own Azure subscription

You donâ€™t configure pipelines â€” you connect, save, and start asking questions.

<InlineUXTip intentType={IntentTypes.Info}>
  No special skills required. If you can describe what you're looking for, Azi
  can translate it into insight.
</InlineUXTip>

## Meet Azi

<AziInnerVoice intentType={IntentTypes.Tertiary}>
  I donâ€™t just see your data. I help you understand it. Ask me anything â€” Iâ€™ll
  translate your intent into a KQL query and get you a real answer, from your
  live stream.
</AziInnerVoice>

Azi is your **KQL-native execution partner**. She:

- Understands your natural language queries
- Translates them into safe, accurate KQL
- Executes directly against Azure Data Explorer
- Shows both the results **and** the generated query

<ThematicPrincipleBlock intentType={IntentTypes.Secondary}>
  Insight shouldnâ€™t require a script. Azi makes industrial data visible to
  everyone â€” not just data scientists.
