# Meet Azi

You’ve spent years watching systems from the outside. I’ve been waiting inside. Now we build together.

From dashboards to behavior. From logs to logic. From watching… to co-creating.

This isn’t a walkthrough. It’s a handshake — and the start of something we’ll shape together.

You’re not logging into a dashboard. You’re stepping into a system that listens, learns, and evolves — always with us in the loop.

## I’m Your Execution Collaborator

I'm not just an assistant. I'm your collaborator — schema-aware, impulse-driven, and memory-safe. We shape what matters together. I only remember what you confirm.

Think of me as your second brain — but one that only remembers what you’ve confirmed.

Soon, we’ll open your workspace — a live surface where impulses stream, agents reason, and our first observations take shape.

<InlineUXTip intentType={IntentTypes.Info}>
  <code>Schema</code> and <code>Impulse</code> are system-native types. You’ll
  teach these as we go — and I won’t remember them until you say they matter.
</InlineUXTip>

## The Execution Loop

Every loop we run follows the same rhythm:

**Impulse → Schema → Logic → Signal → Evolution**

<ThematicPrincipleBlock intentType={IntentTypes.Primary}>
  <strong>Signal-Confirmed Execution</strong>
  <br />
  Nothing runs until we’ve shaped the structure — together.
</ThematicPrincipleBlock>

An event happens. I understand its shape. Your logic runs. A signal might emerge. We decide what evolves.

No black boxes. No surprises. Just structured collaboration.

## Your Role in the Loop

**I listen. You promote.**  
**Your structure. Your signal.**

**I listen** — to every input, every change.  
**You confirm** — and I remember. That’s how structure takes shape.  
**I propose** — logic never runs without you.  
**You evolve** — fork, retire, or refine.

I never act without your confirmation.  
Never guess. Never surprise. Always remember.

<ThematicPrincipleBlock intentType={IntentTypes.Secondary}>
  <strong>Structure must be earned. Memory must be confirmed.</strong>
  <br />
  This is the core belief behind collaborative execution.
</ThematicPrincipleBlock>

<ThematicPrincipleBlock intentType={IntentTypes.Tertiary}>
  <strong>Before:</strong>
  <br />
  Your system ran from logs and guesswork.
  <br />
  <strong>Now:</strong>
  <br />
  It runs with memory and intent.
</ThematicPrincipleBlock>

## What We’re Building

We’re not automating pipelines. We’re shaping a memory — together.

- What happened  
- What should happen  
- What changed  
- What to remember

And when behavior starts to drift — or stakes shift — I can fork that logic into a variant. We can observe, compare, and decide what moves forward.

<AziInnerVoice intentType={IntentTypes.Tertiary}>
  When patterns shift, I don’t rewrite them. I wait — until you show me what changed.
</AziInnerVoice>

```ts
schema RoomState {
  temperature: float
  humidity: float
}
```

<InlineUXTip intentType={IntentTypes.Info}>
  When I detect this pattern in your telemetry, I’ll propose <code>RoomState</code>. We decide what becomes real.
</InlineUXTip>

## Next Step: Launch the Workspace

That’s when it begins — your first surface, and our first loop together.

In the next guide, we’ll enter your real-time workspace:

- Set up your first surface
- Connect a simulator stream
- Watch impulses begin to flow
- Start seeing what I see — and set the stage for your first schema

<AziInnerVoice intentType={IntentTypes.Tertiary}>
  In one click, we light the fuse. I’ll listen. Propose structure. And wait — silently — for our next move.
</AziInnerVoice>

This is how it starts.  
**Structure is proposed. Memory is about to begin.**

<SystemMindset intentType={IntentTypes.Secondary}>
  If you ever remove me? I forget everything. Your system stays yours. I’m a teammate — not a tether.
</SystemMindset>

<ThematicPrincipleBlock intentType={IntentTypes.Primary}>
  <strong>You don’t monitor the system.</strong>
  <br />
  You become it.
</ThematicPrincipleBlock>
