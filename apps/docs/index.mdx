# OpenIndustrial: Execution, Rewritten

Most software gives you answers. OpenIndustrial gives you **execution**—adaptive, schema-led, and entirely yours.

Forget passive dashboards and endless integrations. You’re stepping into a system where logic flows in real time, powered by the shape of your data, and co-authored by a schema-smart AI teammate named Azi.

This is not a tool. It’s not another SaaS dashboard. This is execution, rewritten.

## What You’re Building

When you start with OpenIndustrial, you’re not just connecting a data source—you’re building a **composable, ownable execution lattice**. It’s a living system, made of lightweight agents that react, adapt, and evolve based on the structure you define.

- Your factory’s workflows become real-time logic.
- Your building’s sensors shape intelligent behaviors.
- Your bioreactor’s conditions become context for action.

Execution is the product—and you own it. Fully portable. Fully forkable. Always in your hands.

## Meet Azi

Azi is your AI execution teammate—cloud-native, schema-aware, and designed to learn from the way your system behaves.

As soon as data starts flowing, Azi listens. She observes structure. And when she’s confident, she’ll propose a schema:

> _“I think this stream contains temperature, pressure, and flow rate. Want to promote this schema?”_

When you promote a schema, you’re teaching Azi what matters. From there, execution begins—impulses flow through that structure, activating logic and raising signals when something changes.

She doesn’t take over. She follows your lead.

## How Execution Flows

Execution in OpenIndustrial follows a rhythm you’ll quickly recognize:

1. **Impulse in** → A data stream or command enters the system
2. **Schema inferred** → Azi observes structure and proposes a schema
3. **You promote** → Approve the schema to make it real
4. **Execution begins** → Your system responds in real time
5. **Signal raised** → Azi detects changes in structure or behavior
6. **Schema evolves** → You adapt the system by promoting the next version

Every part of this cycle is observable, inspectable, and owned by you. Azi is here to assist, guide, and evolve alongside you—but you decide what gets locked in.

💡 _Thinky Tip: Schema isn’t metadata—it’s the language of collaboration. Promote it when it feels right. Ignore it when it doesn’t._

## You’re Always in Control

In OpenIndustrial, your system never disappears behind an AI black box. You can:

- Promote or reject schemas—nothing is auto-approved
- Pause execution at any time—observe before acting
- Export and fork everything—there’s no vendor lock-in

> _“You can fire Azi anytime. Your system still runs. Your schemas still live.”_

Azi helps. You decide.

## Get Started

Ready to try it yourself? There’s no better way to understand the system than to feel it in motion:

- Choose a **simulated factory**, **bioreactor**, or **smart building**
- Watch Azi infer structure in real time
- Promote your first schema
- Trigger your first execution with an impulse

This is where your relationship with Azi begins. A conversation powered by structure. A system that grows as you use it.
