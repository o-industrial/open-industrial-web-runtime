# The Open Industrial Manifesto

This isnâ€™t a feature list. Itâ€™s a promise.

Not a legal oneâ€”a personal one.

This is what we believe. And what weâ€™re building to protect.

---

## You Own Your Logic

Every piece of execution logic you write is yours.\
You can pin it. Fork it. Version it. Or take it with you.

---

## You Own Your Data

We donâ€™t harvest, scrape, or retain your structure.\
Azi sees what you show her. And forgets what you take away.

---

## You Own Your Decisions

Signals are just thatâ€”suggestions.\
Only you choose what gets promoted, adapted, or evolved.

---

## Azi Evolves With You, Not For You

She doesnâ€™t guess. She observes.\
She doesnâ€™t overwrite. She asks.\
She learns your world, at your pace, on your terms.

---

## Schema Is Language, Not Configuration

Youâ€™re not configuring a product. Youâ€™re teaching a collaborator.\
Schema promotion is how you formalize what matters.

---

## Execution Is Persistent, Not Ephemeral

You donâ€™t chase insights. You build systems that run.\
Execution surfaces are live, versioned, and fully yours.

---

## Autonomy Is Built-In, Not Opt-In

You can fork anything. Export everything. Leave anytime.\
Azi never locks you in. She works for youâ€”or not at all.

---

## If You Ever Leave

She forgets.\
You donâ€™t lose history. You donâ€™t lose logic. You donâ€™t lose structure.

Everything you builtâ€”every surface, every schema, every signalâ€”remains yours.

You can walk away clean.

---

## This Is Your System

Youâ€™re not just using Open Industrial.\
Youâ€™re co-creating it. With Azi. With intent.

And weâ€™re building it to respect youâ€”especially when youâ€™re done.
